TYPES OF CHATBOT:

1. Closed Domain Retrieval-based Chatbot (Easiest, Mostly on Production level)
2. Closed Domain Generative Chatbot (Hard)
3. Open Domain Generative Chatbot (Hardest, close to AGI)
4. Open Domain Retrieval-based Chatbot (Considerably impossible)

TECHNIQUES OF BUILDING CHATBOT:

1. Rule-based expression match with complex Machine Learning classifiers for predefined responses
2. Deep Learning with translation technique using Sequence to Sequence algorithm

CHALLENGES OF BUILDING CHATBOT:

1. Equipped by Personality
2. Knowing Intention of Conversation
3. Having Diversity on Responses
