HISTORY OF IMAGE CAPTIONING:

1. Network Using CNN + RNN
2. Network Using CRNN + RNN
3. Network Using R-CNN + RNN (Dense Captioning)
4. Network Using CNN + RNN + Attention Mechanism (Visual, Semantic, Adaptive, Channel-Wise, RL)


CHALLENGES OF IMAGE CAPTIONING:

1. Complex Scene with Contextual Understanding
2. Language Grounding Problem
3. Fine-tuning CNN Encoder Using Specific Datasets
4. Describing Objects (Instead of Classifying Objects) & Their Relations

APPLICATION OF IMAGE CAPTIONING:

1. Retrieval-based Image Search engine
2. Creating Contextual Knowledge to Machines As Key Pillars of AI's Ability
