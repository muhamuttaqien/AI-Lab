Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon. Lines: 170 NNTP-Posting-Host: atlantis.csos.orst.edu This is the final public update to my dragon magazine auction. If there are no new bids then the current bids stand (like thats gonna happen. :) ). After this, any updates will be by E-mail *ONLY*. The entire auction will end as soon as the bids stop coming in. So if you want to get in on this, be sure to bid now. All bids must be made in *AT LEAST* 25 cent increments. Buyer will pay shipping. (Unless you have any particular fancy, it will be US mail 4th class special, with lots of padding). All dragons are bagged. The condition of them vary quite a bit, so Ive come up with my own condition system. Some dragons may be missing items like the inserts. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. * Condition ratings - Usually this is just an evaluation of the cover, as most of the material inside is in great shape. Excellent - IE-""As you find them in the store"" Very Good - Still in great condition, but can tell its been boughten Good - On down the line Very Fair/fair - indicates lots of use (But still ""decent"") Poor - Indicates the material inside may be damaged (usually by scissors). A * by the condition indicates that something from the magazine is missing (usually the insert) Ill post another public update sometime this weekend (which will be the final public posting, after which the auction will be by e-mail until the bidding stops) * Again if you have any questions, ask away. * arrow $2.50 056 - Fair *- Top secret module missing - Bard tunes - real maps TN.DE7 $3.0 073 - Good - Forest of Doom module (detached but included) - inner planes ykchev $1.75 074 - Good *- Combat computer missing - 4 dragons TN.DE7 $1.50 078 - Good/VG - Monsters - aquatic AD&D module (detached but included) - Language lesson geoffrey $1.50 079 - Good/VG - top secret module (detached but included) - magic resistance mayla $2.50 081 - Fair - High level AD&D module (detached but included) - poison - material spell components UCCXKVB $2.00 082 - Very Fair*- Baton races game insert missing - spell research TN.DE7 $1.50 083 - Good/VG - Babba Yaggas Hut module (detached but included) - unarmed combat geoffrey $1.50 084 - Fair *- Cover missing - Twofold talisman module squidly $1.75 085 - Good - Twofold Talisman module - Clerics squidly $1.75 087 - Good - Top secret module - Wildernes geoffrey $1.50 088 - Good *- Elefant Hunt insert missing - Falling damage - MARVEL-Phile geoffrey $1.50 089 - Good *- Creature catalog missing - Shields - sci fi TN.DE7 $1.5 094 - Good - Ranger changes - Creature catalog II (detached but included) geoffrey $1.50 095 - Fair *- Cover missing - Into the Forgotten Realms module, detached but included ykcheu $2.75 098 - Fair - 9th anniversary - Dragons - mutant manual UCCXKVB $1.75 099 - Poor *- Cover Missing - Treasure trove II, some pictures cut out thedm $2.50 100 - Good *- poster missing - city beyond the gate module (detached but included) - ""raised dragon"" texture on cover geoffrey $1.50 101 - Fair *- Cover missing - creature catalog III (detached but included) geoffrey $1.50 102 - Fair *- Cover missing - Valley of earth mother middle level module (detached but included) geoffrey $1.50 103 - Fair *- Cover loosly attached - Unearth arcana update missing - Future of AD&D - Centaur papers geoffrey $1.50 103 - Fair *- Unearth arcana update missing geoffrey $1.50 104 - Fair/VF - Marvel module - thieves - cover detached but included geoffrey $1.50 105 - Fair - AD&D module - invisibility - cover & back cover detached but included UCCXKVB $2.00 106 - Fair - Cover 1/2 on - variations of paladins - more skills 4 rangers ykcheu $2.75 106 - Good/VG - Variations of paladins - more skills for rangers arrow $2.50 107 - Fair *- Cover missing - Dragons of glory supplement/questionaire geoffrey $1.50 108 - Good - Mutant manual II - environmental effects - cover taped reinforced thedm $2.00 108 - Very Good - Mutant manual II - environmental effects ykcheu $2.25 109 - Good - Customizing D&D classes - Agent 13 poster geoffrey $1.50 109 - Very Fair - Customizing D&D classes - Agent 13 poster missing geoffrey $1.50 110 - Very Good - House on the frozen lands module -10th anniv squidly $1.75 110 - Very Good - House on the frozen lands module -10th anniv geoffrey $1.50 111 - Good - Murder Mystery AD&D module ykcheu $2.50 112 - Very Good - Ultimate Article Index - Mesozoic monsters mayla $2.50 114 - Very Fair - Elven Cavalier - remorhaz - Witch NPC class ykcheu $1.75 115 - Good - Theives - harpies & snakes squidly $1.75 116 - Good/VG - 3-D ship cardboard insert - wild animals - dr who UCCXKVB $2.50 117 - Good/VG - Dice odds - creative campaigns - sage advice - bazaar geoffrey $1.50 118 - Good - Tournaments/Competitions - Nibars keep game UCCXKVB $2.00 120 - VG/EX - April fools issue UCCXKVB $2.00 121 - Excellent - Oriental adventures - cardboard castle insert geoffrey $1.50 122 - Excellent - 11th aniversary - African beasts - druids UCCXKVB $2.50 123 - Very Good - Magic and wizardry thedm $2.25 123 - Very Good - Magic and wizardry arrow $2.5 124 - Excellent - Aerial adventures - 2nd edition ?aire UCCXKVB $2.25 124 - Excellent - Aerial adventures - 2nd edition ?aire geoffrey $1.50 125 - Very Good - Clay-O-Rama!

Keith Rice) Subject: Re: Drive/Controller Compatibility Lines: 672 Organization: University of North Texas Thanks to all who responded to my original post. I got the number for Western Digital tech support and determined that I need to upgrade the BIOS to the Super BIOS. It will handle hard drives with up to 16 read/ write heads and up to 1024 cylinders. The upgrade is $15, payable by check or money order. Send to: Western Digital Corporation Technical Support Group P.O. Box 19665 Irvine, CA 92713-9665 The Super BIOS is for any WD XT hard drive controller card in the WD1002 series. The BIOS on my system would only handle up to 20mb drives. The responses to my request for help follow my .sig. Warning: Its long.

I already >had an MFM controller. > >I installed the drive and powered up the system. I got a post error, ""1701"". > >My controller is a Western Digital WD1002S-WX2 Rev. C. >As I said above, the drive is a Seagate ST-251. >The system is a Compaq Portable (circa 1985). Ah, finally a question I can answer. I mess with this older stuff alot. Kinda fun. 8) First problem I can forsee is that the ST-251 will not be compadible with that WD card unless it has the right bios rom. Check the numbers on it. It should be the only non-smt chip on the board. Slightly below center, and left. The bios should read either : 62-000042-015 or 62-000094-0x2 If the last 3 digits are 013, you got problems. > >Controller jumpers are set as follows: (""-"" represents jumper) > W1 1-2 3 > W2 1-2 3 > W3 1-2 > W4 1 2-3 > W5 1 2 3 > W6 1-2 3 > W7 1 2 3 Looks right. W5 and W7 are factory jumped (with a trace) between pins 1 and 2 to select the primary controller address. >The drive jumpers are as follows: (""8"" represents jumper) Looks right. [art deleted] >Here are my questions: > >1.) Are the drive and controller compatible w/ each other? I notice you left out the S1 jumper table settings. Those are what control what drive the controller thinks it has. If you have the 62-000042-015 rom, set it like this: 5 + + open 6 + + open 7 + + open 8 + + open 4 + + closed 3 + + closed 2 + + open 1 + + open Note: those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block. Top to bottom. +s represent the jumper pins. Pins 3,4, and 8 select the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 1,2 and 7 select the second drive (drive 1). If you have the 62-000094 rom, its a auto-config, and Ill have to look up how to do it... I dont have the big book right here. >2.) Are the jumpers on the card/drive set correctly? See above. You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are not right. Also, at the risk of being insulting, make sure the cables are on right and good. 8). On the jumper on the 251, try moving it to the opposite side of the drive. Its one or the other. The narrow data cable goes to J2. Ive thrown it on J3 a few times and banged my head for a day..... >3.) Is my systems BIOS in need of an upgrade? Dunno. IBM roms had to be later than 10/27/82. A quick way to check is to boot dos and run debug. Enter: -d f000:fff5 fffc (the - is the debug prompt) This will return the rom date, if its of any use. >Keith Rice If I oversimplified any of the above, I appologize. Its just hard to know what caliber of person Im talking to. 8). --> Bob Valentine <-- --> <-- From Mon Apr 5 06:33:46 1993 Received: from unitrix.utr.ac.za by ponder (5.61/1.36) id AA16194; Mon, 5 Apr 93 06:32:59 -0500 Received: by unitrix.utr.ac.za (Smail3.1.28.1 #1) id m0nfpMA-0001X7C; Mon, 5 Apr 93 13:28 GMT Message-Id: From: (Prof P.

NOTE 1: AT&T 6300 - The AT&T 6300 and the AT&T 6300 PLUS contain system BIOS chips that support the hard disk drive. When using a Western Digital XT controller card the system will not ""boot."" To solve this problem, one of the ROM BIOS chips must be disabled. To disable the BIOS on your Western Digital XT controller card, you must remove the jumper at position W-3 or add a jumper at position R-23 (depending on which model of XT controller you are using). -2- NOTE 2: TANDY 1000 SYSTEMS - The WD1002A-WX1, WD1004A-WX1, WDXT-GEN2 and the WD1004-27X can be modified to operate in Tandy 1000 series computers, models SX, TX and the original or ""A"" version. These computers utilize an interrupt of 2 (IRQ2) instead of IRQ5, the IBM standard. To modify the WD1002A-WX1 or the WD1002-27X to operate in these systems, you must cut the etch between pin 1 and pin 2 at jumper position W-7. Then solder pin 2 and pin 3 at the position (W-7). To complete the modification, a jumper must be added to position 7 of switch S-1 (2 rows of 8 pins). PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY PHYSICAL MODIFICATION TO YOUR WESTERN DIGITAL HARD DISK CONTROLLER VOIDS THE WARRANTY ON YOUR BOARD. To modify the WD1004A-WX1, WDXT-GEN2 or the WD1004-27X for your Tandy 1000 system, a zero ohm resister must be soldered to jumper position W-27. This will change the interrupt from IRQ5 to IRQ2.

UK. Supersedes: Lines: 632 Archive-name: atheism/logic Alt-atheism-archive-name: logic Last-modified: 5 April 1993 Version: 1.4 Constructing a Logical Argument Although there is much argument on Usenet, the general quality of argument found is poor. This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to logic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate. Logic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise OED]. Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether it is correct or not (valid or invalid). Of course, one does not need to study logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an argument. Note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally applicable. The matter is very much open for debate. This document merely explains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is the right tool for the job. Propositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A proposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, ""It is raining"" or ""Today is Tuesday"". Propositions may be either asserted (said to be true) or denied (said to be false). Note that this is a technical meaning of ""deny"", not the everyday meaning. The proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular arrangement of words used to express it. So ""God exists"" and ""There exists a God"" both express the same proposition. An argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, ""a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition"". An argument consists of three stages. First of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to continue are stated. These are called the premises of the argument. They are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions. Premises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as ""because"", ""since"", ""obviously"" and so on. (The phrase ""obviously"" is often viewed with suspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious premises. If something doesnt seem obvious to you, dont be afraid to question it. You can always say ""Oh, yes, youre right, it is obvious"" when youve heard the explanation.) Next, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known as inference. In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of one or more other propositions already accepted. There are various forms of valid inference. The propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further inference. Inference is often denoted by phrases such as ""implies that"" or ""therefore"". Finally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which is affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference. Conclusions are often indicated by phrases such as ""therefore"", ""it follows that"", ""we conclude"" and so on. The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference. For example: Every event has a cause (premise) The universe has a beginning (premise) All beginnings involve an event (premise) This implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference) Therefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion) Note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another argument. A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with respect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation. Sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example, the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated afterwards in support of the conclusion. This is perfectly valid, if sometimes a little confusing. Recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or conclusions. Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever producing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument. Some statements look like arguments, but are not. For example: ""If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar, or the Son of God."" This is not an argument, it is a conditional statement. It does not assert the premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its conclusion. (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but well come to those later.) Another example: ""God created you; therefore do your duty to God."" The phrase ""do your duty to God"" is not a proposition, since it is neither true nor false. Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an argument. Finally, causality is important. Consider a statement of the form ""A because B"". If were interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the statement is an argument. If were trying to establish the truth of B, then it is not an argument, it is an explanation. For example: ""There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not start."" -- This is an argument. ""My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine."" -- This is an explanation. There are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive. A deductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions -- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. A deductive argument is either valid or invalid. A valid argument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the conclusion is true. An inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the truth of the conclusion. Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid; however, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other arguments, and about how probable their premises are. There are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive nor inductive. However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive arguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing. It is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does not imply that its conclusion holds. This is because of the slightly counter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more carefully. Obviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions. However, an argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions. For example: All insects have wings (premise) Woodlice are insects (premise) Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion) Here, the conclusion is not true because the arguments premises are false. If the arguments premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true. The argument is thus entirely valid. More subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises, as in: All fish live in the sea (premise) Dolphins are fish (premise) Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion) However, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid inference from true premises. We can therefore draw up a ""truth table"" for implication. The symbol ""=>"" denotes implication; ""A"" is the premise, ""B"" the conclusion. ""T"" and ""F"" represent true and false respectively. Premise Conclusion Inference A B A=>B ---------------------------- F F T If the premises are false and the inference F T T valid, the conclusion can be true or false. T F F If the premises are true and the conclusion false, the inference must be invalid. T T T If the premises are true and the inference valid, the conclusion must be true. A sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true. A sound argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion. Be careful not to confuse valid arguments with sound arguments. To delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy. It is simpler and probably more useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing an argument. These pitfalls are known as fallacies. In everyday English the term ""fallacy"" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs as well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs. This is fair enough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of technically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or convincing. So for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical argument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect when examined more closely. By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being misled by them. The following list of fallacies is not intended to be exhaustive. ARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE) The Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion. It is often used by politicians, and can be summarized as ""might makes right"". The force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer. For example: ""... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible. All those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell."" ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM Argumentum ad hominem is literally ""argument directed at the man"". The Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying to disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or people making the assertion. This is invalid because the truth of an assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it. For example: ""Atheism is an evil philosophy. It is practised by Communists and murderers."" Sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by showing, for example, that he is a known perjurer. This is a valid way of reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not argumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witnesss testimony is false. To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the Argumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list). The circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the opponents particular circumstances. For example: ""It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food. How can you argue otherwise when youre quite happy to wear leather shoes?"" This is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing the opponents argument. This fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion. For example: ""Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing. Youre white."" This particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that ones adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is also known as ""poisoning the well"". ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM Argumentum ad ignorantium means ""argument from ignorance"". This fallacy occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it has not been proved false. Or, equivalently, when it is argued that something must be false because it has not been proved true. (Note that this is not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved true, a basic scientific principle.) Examples: ""Of course the Bible is true. Nobody can prove otherwise."" ""Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist. Nobody has shown any proof that they are real."" Note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is generally assumed innocent until proven guilty. Also, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce certain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can validly be used to infer that the event did not occur. For example: ""A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the earth. The earth does not have a tenth as much water, even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles. Therefore no such flood occurred."" In science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has not occurred. We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred, however. ARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM This is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading. The fallacy is committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a conclusion accepted. For example: ""I did not murder my mother and father with an axe. Please dont find me guilty; Im suffering enough through being an orphan."" ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM This is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People. To commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appealing to a large group of people. This form of fallacy is often characterized by emotive language. For example: ""Pornography must be banned. It is violence against women."" ""The Bible must be true. Millions of people know that it is. Are you trying to tell them that they are all mistaken fools?"" ARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM This fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum. It consists of asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more likely it is that that proposition is correct. ARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM The Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win support for an assertion. For example: ""Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God."" This line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a discussion of that subject. For example, we can distinguish quite clearly between: ""Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation"" and ""John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent computer"" Hawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black hole radiation to be informed. Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable whether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence. THE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT The Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a particular case whose ""accidental"" circumstances mean that the rule is inapplicable. It is the error made when one goes from the general to the specific. For example: ""Christians generally dislike atheists. You are a Christian, so you must dislike atheists."" This fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules. CONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION This fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident. It occurs when one forms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not representative of all possible cases. For example: ""Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian. Therefore all Christians are insincere."" SWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER A sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a particular situation in which the features of that particular situation render the rule inapplicable. A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a hasty generalization. NON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC These are known as False Cause fallacies. The fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the cause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause. For example: ""I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared. So God cured me of the headache."" The fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event. For example: ""The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism. Therefore we must avoid atheism for the same reasons."" CUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC This fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc. It asserts that because two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves no room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events. PETITIO PRINCIPII This fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the conclusion reached. CIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO This fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one wishes to reach. Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the fallacy appears to be a valid argument. For example: ""Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office. Hence any government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job. Therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open to blackmail. Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government office."" Note that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the conclusion. An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason for the British Secret Services official ban on homosexual employees. Another example is the classic: ""We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so. And we know that the Bible is true because it is the word of God."" COMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION This is the Fallacy of Presupposition. One example is the classic loaded question: ""Have you stopped beating your wife?"" The question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not even been asked. This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination, when they ask questions like: ""Where did you hide the money you stole?"" Similarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as: ""How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?"" or ""Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?"" IGNORATIO ELENCHI The fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do with that conclusion. For example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the teachings of Christianity are undoubtably true. If he then argues at length that Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he argues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true. Sadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse emotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more favourable light. EQUIVOCATION Equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different meanings in the same argument. For example: ""What could be more affordable than free software? But to make sure that it remains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable."" AMPHIBOLY Amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because of careless or ungrammatical phrasing. ACCENT Accent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning. In this case, the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are emphasized. For example, consider: ""We should not speak ILL of our friends"" and ""We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS"" FALLACIES OF COMPOSITION One fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts of something must apply to the whole. For example: ""The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very lightweight."" The other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number of individual items is shared by a collection of those items. For example: ""A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus. Therefore cars are less environmentally damaging than buses."" FALLACY OF DIVISION The fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition. Like its opposite, it exists in two varieties. The first is to assume that a property of some thing must apply to its parts. For example: ""You are studying at a rich college. Therefore you must be rich."" The other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by each item. For example: ""Ants can destroy a tree. Therefore this ant can destroy a tree."" THE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT This argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful events. There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the first event. For example: ""If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and well have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare. Therefore we cannot legalize marijuana."" ""A IS BASED ON B"" FALLACIES / ""IS A TYPE OF"" FALLACIES These fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way similar without actually specifying in what way they are similar. Examples: ""Isnt history based upon faith? If so, then isnt the Bible also a form of history?"" ""Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isnt Islam a form of Christianity?"" ""Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, so arent dogs a form of cat?"" AFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT This fallacy is an argument of the form ""A implies B, B is true, therefore A is true"". To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for implication given earlier. DENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT This fallacy is an argument of the form ""A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false"". Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is a fallacy. Note that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has the form ""A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false"", where A does NOT in fact imply B at all. Here, the problem is not that the implication is invalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce anything about B. CONVERTING A CONDITIONAL This fallacy is an argument of the form ""If A then B, therefore if B then A"". ARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM This is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply because it is old, or because ""thats the way its always been."" ARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM This is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer than something else. ARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM The fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those with more money are more likely to be right. ARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM The fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or more virtuous than one who is wealthier. This fallacy is the opposite of the argumentum ad crumenam. ARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM This is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the more often it is heard. An ""argumentum ad nauseum"" is one that employs constant repetition in asserting something. BIFURCATION Also referred to as the ""black and white"" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when one presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other alternatives exist or can exist. PLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS This fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex question. NON SEQUITUR A non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises which are not logically connected with it. RED HERRING This fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue being discussed, so that everyones attention is diverted away from the points being made, towards a different conclusion. REIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION Reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing. SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF The burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or proposition. Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad ignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or questions the assertion being made. The source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise. STRAW MAN The straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone elses position so that it can be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position, then to conclude that the original position has been demolished. It is a fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been made. THE EXTENDED ANALOGY The fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general rule is being argued over. The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two different situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a claim that those situations are analogous to each other. This fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about anti-cryptography legislation: ""I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it."" ""Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported Martin Luther King."" ""Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the struggle for Black liberation? How dare you!"" TU QUOQUE This is the famous ""you too"" fallacy. It occurs when an action is argued to be acceptable because the other party has performed it. For instance: ""Youre just being randomly abusive."" ""So? Youve been abusive too."" ÿ "

[1] Born 1964 Secretary-Typist Azsantekmontazh Trust Sumgait Construction and Installation Administration Secretary of the SMU Komsomol Organization Resident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15 Microdistrict No. 3 Sumgait [Azerbaijan] On the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven oclock show, at the theater that is across from the City Party Committee, about 50 yards away. The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, ""The Abyss."" Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at the City Party Committee, but they were silent, theres no conversation whatsoever, and we couldnt figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it was about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if someone gave a speech or not, we didnt know. We bought our tickets. There were 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that large movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the film. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well mostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an Armenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do to Armenian girls. I thought thats what they meant because they had demanded a girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move over, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone recognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina. It got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--its only opened at the end of the show--and they returned to their seats. Everyone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis, people of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the auditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and gradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, ""OK, weve scared them enough, lets leave."" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to me that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of ""anasha"", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like they were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing had happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful films which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We could barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine, and it was dark . . . Marina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, thats the center of town. Lenin Street was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting, something about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We werent especially listening, because the way we were feeling we didnt know if we were going to make it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation wasnt running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police, policemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the doors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors there are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief- stricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well, since he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super serious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we live literally one stop away. We didnt want to go on foot, not because it was dark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the driver didnt want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and he said hed take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well, OK . . . So we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was happening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation was at a standstill and everyone was shouting ""Ka-ra-bagh,"" theyre not going to give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family whats going on, and theres immediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had come, they were going to come, kill us, thats it . . . Somehow we managed to cheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway, just what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma down. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though nothing had happened. That was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didnt go anywhere and didnt call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on. That day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldnt guess. On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always had. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda, Marina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and no one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that morning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at home and didnt know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda Zimogliad, came by at around three oclock I think. We worked together, we did our apprenticeships together, shes a Russian girl. She said that something awful was happening in town. I asked, ""Dont they want Armenians? Well what are they after, if theyre already in that state?"" She says, no, nothing like that, its just a demonstration, but its awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels like a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The cabs, the buses, well its just a nightmare. Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy problems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera, asked him, ""Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going on in the courtyard; arent you afraid to go out?"" Papa didnt know what she was talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home and told Mamma. Mamma said, ""Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means that something is really going on."" But we didnt go see her, shes a Russian, she lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five oclock I tell Lyuda, ""Ok, look, its time for you to go, its late already, Ill see you out."" Mamma says, ""You dont need to go, its too late already, you can see what the situation in town is."" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was ready. Mamma says, ""Let her eat with us, then she can go."" We sat down at the table. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything out on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that were eating. We turned on the television, and the show ""In Fairy-Tale Land"" was coming on. We cleared the table. We hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I cant see whats going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus station, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people . . . I cant figure out whats happening. Theyre shouting something, looking somewhere, I cant make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, shes an Azerbaijani; weve been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down to look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story buildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20 people, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see several people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide that means its not all that bad if they are laughing: it means theyre not killing anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of the soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their feet, everyones kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . . cant speak . . . Well, theyve probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . . If each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him and started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldnt see if he got up and left or not. I become terrified and go home and say, ""Lyuda, dont go anywhere, stay at our place, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . "" Then the crowd runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and starts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors are also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it turns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and kept them from coming in. Theres only one entryway there, they could stop them. They all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows, afraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the windows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard, and its packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they dont crush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. Its just a huge cloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey Sargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear tramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous din and roar. Its incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were shouting Fathers name, ""Grisha, open the door, weve come to kill you!,"" or something like that. I dont remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma says, ""Into the bedroom, quickly!"" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part of our dowry; Mamma says, ""Hide there, they probably wont come in there, theyll ask something, say something, and leave."" She says, ""Well tell them that we live alone here."" I cant imagine that my parents will stand out in the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say that Ill stand together with them, Ill talk with them if they come, maybe I can find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak Azerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and Lyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I cant remember if I told her anything or not. Then . . . they open the door: its like they blew on it and it broke and fell right into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here, leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I tell them, ""What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what has happened."" In Azerbaijani, they say, ""Get out of the apartment, leave."" I say, ""OK. Go downstairs. Well gather everything we need and leave the apartment."" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with them, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the doorway, the young guys, say, ""There are old people and one girl with them. Too bad!"" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have pacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts, commanding them: ""Dont you understand what you are saying? Kill them?"" And that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one room, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start undressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there, in front of Mamma. I dont remember where they went, what they did, or how much time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body, and tore my clothes, all at the same time, I dont even know what I said. The atrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among themselves who would go first. Later, I remember, I came to. I dont know if Im dead or alive. Someone comes in, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding. He looks around at whats happening. At that instant everything stops. It seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything depends on him. He looks and says, ""Well, were done here."" They are beating Mamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs . . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that shes dead. Papa . . . was out cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they cant get the window open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the windows cant be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking about being thrown out the window and passed out. Shes not a real strong person anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that Im saying something, that Im still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be, which is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they dont get any entreaty out of me. I already know that Im dead, why would I humble myself before anyone? And he says that if thats what I think, since my tongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing . . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside. I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I dont know if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by my arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings, something metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone else is pinching me . . .I dont even know. I think, my God, when will death come? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near the entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What happened after that, how many people there were, I dont remember. I come to after a while, I dont remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me clothing. Im entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember that I said the same words over and over again: ""Mamma, what happened, Mamma, what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?"" I cant make sense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he served in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all went to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his courage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors, even though hes small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he served in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served there, I think; now hes stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor brought me to the neighbors, and then helped me come to my senses, saying, ""Karina, I know you, calm down, Im not one of them."" How do I know whos who and whats what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then Papa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda said that she was Russian, they said, well let you go, we arent touching the Russians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides shes going to tell them shes Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marinas and Lyudas hands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our sister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbors and starts pounding on the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in there. So they survived. My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things. While they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back up again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed there. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put it on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbors on the fourth floor, the one whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and knocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, ""Im not going to let you in the apartment because Im afraid of them. But Ill give you some stockings and well leave the building."" Lyuda says, ""Ill stay at your place because of whats going on, they keep going up and down the stairs."" It was just for a moment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldnt consent. Lyuda came back to our place and lay under the bed . . . I came to. Mother was there. I cant remember my supervisors telephone number, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he came to get us. He didnt have any idea what was going on. He thought we were simply afraid, he didnt know that they were killing us and that we had passed between life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct. There they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly, it was hard to breathe . . . My supervisors name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. Hes the head of our administration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary passenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right after eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a great many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and what was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not only in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next, without stopping. After us. I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from Buildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died from Building 16, thats the building in front of ours. There young Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldnt let it into their building. Incidentally, when we were at the neighbors, Marina called our relatives to warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in Microdistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, ""Run quickly, I cant explain whats going on; hide, do what you can, just stay alive. Hide at Azerbaijanis, ones who wont give you away."" At that moment three people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such awful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up, there was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything out of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face was pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my normal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to scream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you here, havent you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of the soldiers said, ""Dont scream at us. Were Muslims, but were not from the Sumgait police. They called in from Daghestan."" So at that point the Daghestan police were there. When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there, there were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I dont know, maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously injured to treat them there in the police precinct. I dont know what they were there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda and me and said, ""These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we dont know what to do with the rest."" So they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My boss said, ""Dont worry, Ill find you, no matter where you are, no matter what happens."" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department head from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She examined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait ambulances hadnt done anything, they didnt respond to any calls. People called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life. That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something very good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself, ""God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?"" She looks me over and says, ""Now why are you suffering so? You dont know what your people have been doing, your people did even worse things."" And I think, great, I have to deal with her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why dont I just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this condition and being told about something that our people did. I just didnt have the energy to say, ""How could our people possibly be smart enough to think of something that yours havent already done?"" I stayed there. Then they brought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her own apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next morning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didnt do anything to help us. This was in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didnt do anything more than examine me, that was it. I didnt want any shots or tranquilizer, nothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didnt even want to look at them. I lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur- pose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face was disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, ""Better to ask your brother what happened, theres no point in asking me, your brother can better explain what happened."" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw themselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my ward. Then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me clothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress, but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up above my knees, and the woman orderly said, ""I cant believe you put on such a short dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?"" I went back to my ward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and brought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I couldnt take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said that I couldnt take the apples, and really didnt have any appetite. No one had to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . . Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an Armenian, maybe they wouldnt figure it out from looking at me. So they must have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something else would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on the street, I dont know. In any case, I didnt sleep a wink that night. The next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus, and off we went. I didnt even know where they were taking me. They took me to the club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening. I got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw a few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought that I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait after that night. I still didnt know what happened to my parents, they didnt come to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine. I didnt know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm me down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw a lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each other and asking, ""What happened, what went on?"" Two days later they came to see me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed interest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they could. Of course Im most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues who didnt lose his presence of mind and who didnt change his opinions, neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what happened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart . . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came, not from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part of, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements with the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by myself I couldnt get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my lungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I lay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be from all the blows, I dont know. They didnt diagnose anything in particular. When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful. There was no way something inside wasnt broken, my ribs . . . Well they took me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were emergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marinas friends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Childrens Clinic. They had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I needed at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty breathing, I couldnt seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me. They put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some people saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I wasnt cut. They took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon appeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not talk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, ""We demand that Seidov come!"" The response was, ""Its Seidov who sent us."" Seidov is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said, ""Well only see Seidovs daughter, have her come here, well do the same things to her that they did to our daughters, and then well deal with you agitators."" And so on. More of them said, ""Have Seidov himself come."" This went on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us out of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because they realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The smell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who had literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a club that didnt even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay to eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day someone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill. Everything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie theater with seating for no more than 500. You couldnt sit or lie down, it was impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants took ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in Yerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to mention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting right and left. I just dont know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only the young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women were in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come any minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered together purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie theater and there wouldnt be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to the attic. I didnt see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and couldnt get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently they caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the theater. Maybe someone saw them, I didnt. I was in no condition to open my eyes. Everyone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, ""Arent you an Azerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think youre an Azerbaijani."" They led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their passports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did not have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in nothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like they should have, with their IDs. So on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On Monday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didnt spare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed, they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered the Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter- in-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only the two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself, she ran away, the neighbors wouldnt take her in, so she ran about the building until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children. This all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were already in the city. They murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire families. They say they didnt even know for sure if the people were Armenians or not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. Im not sure myself, I didnt see any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so its very difficult now to say exactly who died and who didnt. It was very difficult to identify the corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in gasoline and burned . . . its all very hard to imagine, of course I heard that many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people, including a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in Microdistrict 3. They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were going home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply savagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that hoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians out and killed them on the spot. I didnt see it myself, but I heard that they put them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from the corpses, well you cant call them corpses, you had to figure out from the ashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira G., if Im not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and she still cant figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that whole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and carried her to the city. I still cant imagine how he managed to do that. I heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of people went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a song in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has that piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song, the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They couldnt find the guy who saved her. He left her in someones apartment and called the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me, she couldnt remember anyones face. I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had talked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked out of my head. I cant remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw the Secretary of the Directorates Party organization, where Marina works. She goes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at the Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. Im the Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint meetings. I know them all, Ive even talked with them, and he, I know, is from Armenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of those people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia. They took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the Procuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden- tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They showed me the people who were in our apartment, theyre working on our case, but I cant even recognize them, although it was proved that they were the ones, theyre processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were dragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch me, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these people, all of them, as much as Ive heard about them and seen them, they were all from Kafan. The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was there when everything started. It must have been him because I didnt recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since I told him, ""Listen, you do something, because you know me."" He turned away and went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldnt see Marina anyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldnt make out anyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became myself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people there. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his name. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one were part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, ""If hes here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his alibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think Im crazy, not responsible for my words."" He said, ""What did they do to you, how awful, myself, I hid an Armenian family."" Then after some time goes by he comes back again and says something entirely different: ""I wasnt at home, my family and I went to Baku."" I said, ""Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally different before."" After that I didnt go to see our Procurator, our case is being handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me that Rzayevs case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved. What are they doing with Rzayev? Did he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the head I cant say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an insult if he was in our apartment and doesnt have to pay for it, but at the same time Im afraid to say Im a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat- ter who I name, they tell me, no, youre wrong, he didnt do that, that one wasnt there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what exactly I cant say. When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didnt see it, because I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got it because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my face I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed, they took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he works at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41, is where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ dormitory is over there, thats where he lives. Now hes in custody, they even have proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the clarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our building was killed, it was that man. A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didnt come over, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was all over, people started making announcements in town saying that investigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now theyve caught him, everythings been proved. Now, evidently, theyve been beating him, I dont know what theyre doing with them over there, but he himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy came to the plant and said, ""Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the bus station on Saturday at ten."" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to, went. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday night. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do you mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent, probably, in their hearts they were thinking, Im going to go. But they didnt say anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go, because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had killed their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of that. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too. from Ive participated in the investigation a couple of times. Im satisfied with them thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word I said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an Armenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I dont know. His last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from Microdistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time. His mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani KGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many photographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at curfew, and Ive got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this, the guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a haystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he is so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I dont know what he did, I cant remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment. At the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, theres no need for this, all this stuff, look me in the eyes, youre like a sister to me. I took a look at him and thought, ""My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like you."" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything without great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when she came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over the table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the balcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had all kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters. They stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that moment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the faces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the apartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when Ive got three kids and no place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didnt have anywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the apartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the apartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. Thats what they said. How did they know there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that Armenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the building, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis lived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didnt set fire to our apartment. I dont know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt when I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would have said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but probably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at a free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were being fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have been fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from our building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, ""Karina, we saw all of it, how could it happen?"" Theyre asking me! Well I just dont know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to me. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldnt have been able to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani woman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated woman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two Armenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She came down to the entryway and said, ""Youll come in this entryway over my dead body."" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didnt even know what they were doing. I dont think thats true. They knew very well what they were doing if they didnt even lift a hand against that woman. They couldnt have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani stopped them. They were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place they were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the apartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that? Maybe Im losing my mind? But no, theyre all chewing something. Maybe it is some kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed to be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had come to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They didnt talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They screamed and screamed: ""Yeah, killing, killing, were killing the Armenians!"" Only they didnt shout ""kill,"" they shouted ""gurun ermianlary."" Gurun literally means ""kill,"" or ""destroy."" Thats how it was! Ill continue. We hid in a captains apartment, hes an Azerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their kids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part of the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldnt find Lyuda she took Papas hand, this was while the looters were stealing things, but they didnt pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the courage to . . . A boy said to my mother ""Wheres the gold?"" Mamma said he must have been 12 to 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the fair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where the gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a little black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesnt really like to wear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were bought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma thinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and Mamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth, bound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and tore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having trouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted to open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by accident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake, ""Whats happened?"" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, ""At least go and find out whats happening to my daughters, even if theyve burned them or murdered them, at least bring the corpses."" He went looking for us. At that moment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that someone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldnt get out from under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought she was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to herself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from under the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost her mind. Ill never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that way to me, Ill come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled down, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from outside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I dont remember what order it happened in. And Mamma said, ""Listen, theyre all running around down there, shouting something or other, and running toward the other building."" It had more or less calmed down where we were. Whos dead, whos alive, we dont know. I tried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, ""Listen; lets go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We dont know how long well be here. Maybe they didnt burn everything."" I dont get it, all women have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe not everything was taken? I tell Mamma, ""Mamma, what do you need any of that for? To hell with it! Were alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!"" She says, ""No, lets go get at least something. Maybe well leave here, spend the night at someone elses."" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son Alik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were coming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He shouts, ""Come back, theyre coming!"" They didnt have enough time to get a lot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my knitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore, out of the hall . . . Someone took Fathers old coveralls. The neighbor, his wife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to leave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs, theyre dragging something again. They were going toward the other building, maybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over there, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished building, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more or less calmed down. I tried to call my boss. Later there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom apartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor, Asya Dallakian. Shes an old woman, retired. She wasnt at home, at that time she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and her grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started pounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there, something like that, shes a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even live there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and mattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television. They started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, ""My God, what is going on around here? When will this end?"" We turned off the lights and sat. As it turns out the people who werent afraid, the ones who knew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didnt know, but they didnt come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that he was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his apartment. His last name was Kasumov. Hes an exserviceman, retired, works up at the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door. They tell him, ""Comrade Captain, dont worry, we wont harm you, youre one of us."" He went upstairs, and they say, ""Arent you taking anything from this apartment?"" He says, ""I dont need anything."" And the women who were standing in the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were standing in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the first floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time to into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty pillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really mad, and he says, ""Wheres the rug? I just put it right here!"" They tell him, ""Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school."" He ran off in that direction. Oh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms, there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They just didnt tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man, she didnt want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told me, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them, the ringleader, apparently a young man, said, ""Wheres the girl who was here?"" And he became furious. The woman tells him, ""She came to . . . "" She didnt know what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would comb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, ""She came to and went to the basement."" Now, our basement is full of water. So the whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took flashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been standing there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there to get me. Then one of them said, ""Theres so much water down there, she probably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in the basement. Thats it, we can leave, no problem!"" I didnt know that, and when I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didnt just want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . . After that we of course didnt want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really didnt want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and started to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all. Although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people who sat in their apartments and didnt help us at a time like that. I think that they could have helped! I dont think that they were obligated to, but they could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole brutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been enough foe one man or women to say, What do you think youre doing?"" Thats all! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not one person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were standing on their balconies I didnt hear anyones voice, no one said what are you doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a bomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for one of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway, an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom: if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed to stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they stomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, ""If you want to go on living, youll disappear into your apartment."" So she left. That trick didnt work on them. Even the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget that it happened. I said Id only forget it if I told them right then that it had happened to their daughter--and if that didnt have any effect on them, then I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister. And no one did anything. Anything.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links. For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans. Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement. Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer. It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files. While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals. A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the ""Clipper Chip"" has been developed by government engineers. The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology. It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone. It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today. This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically. At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. A ""key-escrow"" system will be established to ensure that the ""Clipper Chip"" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans. Each device containing the chip will have two unique 2 ""keys,"" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device. When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two ""key-escrow"" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General. Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap. The ""Clipper Chip"" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices. In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings. The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryptions dual-edge sword: encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists. We need the ""Clipper Chip"" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities. In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates: -- the privacy of our citizens, including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes; -- the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data, under proper court or other legal order, when necessary to protect our citizens; -- the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the National Information Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of American industry in the global marketplace; and -- the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export high technology products. The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed. 3 The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information. This infrastructure of high-speed networks (""information superhighways"") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as todays telephone system transmits voice. Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use. The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law. Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. The provisions of the Presidents directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available. For additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of Standards and Technology, (301) 975-2758. --------------------------------- QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATIONS TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE Q: Does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations? A: No. ""Clipper Chip"" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans. Q: Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device. What would they have to do to decipher the message? A: They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a court order, to do the wiretap in the first place. They would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers. The key is split into two parts, which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system. Q: Who will run the key-escrow data banks? A: The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities. At this point, the Department of Justice and the Administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key-escrow data banks. Q: How strong is the security in the device? How can I be sure how strong the security is? A: This system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today. While the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities. Q: Whose decision was it to propose this product? A: The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in this decision. This approach has been endorsed by the President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet officials. Q: Who was consulted? The Congress? Industry? A: We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy. We have briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative. Q: Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers? A: The government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers. Product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them. Q: Who provides the ""Clipper Chip""? A: Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance, California, and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers. The programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future. Q: How do I buy one of these encryption devices? A: We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the ""Clipper Chip"" into their devices. Q: If the Administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices? A: This is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review. The key escrow mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive than others readily available today, but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology, which the Administration is developing. The Administration is not saying, ""since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement, we will prohibit it outright"" (as some countries have effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that ""every American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product."" There is a false ""tension"" created in the assessment that this issue is an ""either-or"" proposition. Rather, both concerns can be, and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned, balanced approach such as is proposed with the ""Clipper Chip"" and similar encryption techniques. Q: What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton Administrations policy toward encryption will differ from that of the Bush Administration? A: It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public-interest groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism. Q: Will the devices be exportable? Will other devices that use the government hardware? A: Voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements. Case-by-case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices. The same is true for other encryption devices. One of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad. With this in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad. We plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products. -- Jim Gillogly Trewesday, 25 Astron S.R. 1993, 17:01 "

Xt Glossary ---------------------------------------------------------------------- o The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code to allow useful graphical components to be created. Included with this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object, RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell, etc. The terms ""Xt"" and ""Intrinsics"" are used interchangeably, however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X window system. In particular, it does not include the Athena, Motif, OLIT or any other widget set. Without further widgets the Intrinsics are not especially useful. o A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt. The precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class. It is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the Object class although these are more accurately called windowless widgets or gadgets. o Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol. It is one layer below the Xt Intrinsics. Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib functions because Xt provides most such services although an understanding of Xlib helps with problems. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- In brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for critical sections. Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of the above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the appropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of a list traversal, etc. Note that the ANSI C standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions. The only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the interrupt handler. This flag later needs to be checked either by a work procedure or a timeout callback. It is incorrect to add either of these in the interrupt handler. As another note, it is dangerous to add a work procedure that never finishes. This effectively preempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never be called. Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loop about the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handler can write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal. However, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up. Why dont the Intrinsics deal with this problem? Primarily because it is supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating system. Is that a good enough reason -- I dont think so. Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in OReilly Volume 6 are in error. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 4. How do I use a different visual than the default? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- This requires a more complicated answer than it should. A window has three things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap and border pixmap. All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap resource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questions deals with why shells have a Visual). The default value of these resources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says. In the shell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen and DefaultColormapOfScreen. When any one of the three resources is not properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window is created. They are not properly set because each of the values depends on the visual being used. How to get this to work? There are two parts to the answer. The first is if you want an application to start with a particular visual and the second is if you want a particular shell within an application to start with a different visual. The second is actually easier because the basic information you need is available. The first is a little harder because youll need to initialize much of the toolkit yourself in order to determine the needed information. /* * Some sample code to start up an application using something other * than the default visual. * * To compile: * cc -g visual.c -o visual -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm * * To run: * ./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual StaticColor -fg blue -bg yellow * * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap * to install. */ #include <X11/Intrinsic.h> #include <X11/StringDefs.h> #include <X11/Shell.h> typedef struct { Visual *visual; int depth; } OptionsRec; OptionsRec Options; XtResource resources[] = { {""visual"", ""Visual"", XtRVisual, sizeof (Visual *), XtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, visual), XtRImmediate, NULL}, {""depth"", ""Depth"", XtRInt, sizeof (int), XtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, depth), XtRImmediate, NULL}, }; XrmOptionDescRec Desc[] = { {""-visual"", ""*visual"", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL}, {""-depth"", ""*depth"", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL} }; int main (argc, argv) int argc; char **argv; { XtAppContext app; /* the application context */ Widget top; /* toplevel widget */ Display *dpy; /* display */ char **xargv; /* saved argument vector */ int xargc; /* saved argument count */ Colormap colormap; /* created colormap */ XVisualInfo vinfo; /* template for find visual */ XVisualInfo *vinfo_list; /* returned list of visuals */ int count; /* number of matchs (only 1?) */ Arg args[10]; Cardinal cnt; char *name = ""test""; char *class = ""Test""; /* * save the command line arguments */ xargc = argc; xargv = (char **) XtMalloc (argc * sizeof (char *)); bcopy ((char *) argv, (char *) xargv, argc * sizeof (char *)); /* * The following creates a _dummy_ toplevel widget so we can * retrieve the appropriate visual resource. */ cnt = 0; top = XtAppInitialize (&app, class, Desc, XtNumber (Desc), &argc, argv, (String *) NULL, args, cnt); dpy = XtDisplay (top); cnt = 0; XtGetApplicationResources (top, &Options, resources, XtNumber (resources), args, cnt); cnt = 0; if (Options.visual && Options.visual != DefaultVisualOfScreen (XtScreen (top))) { XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNvisual, Options.visual); ++cnt; /* * Now we create an appropriate colormap. We could * use a default colormap based on the class of the * visual; we could examine some property on the * rootwindow to find the right colormap; we could * do all sorts of things... */ colormap = XCreateColormap (dpy, RootWindowOfScreen (XtScreen (top)), Options.visual, AllocNone); XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNcolormap, colormap); ++cnt; /* * Now find some information about the visual. */ vinfo.visualid = XVisualIDFromVisual (Options.visual); vinfo_list = XGetVisualInfo (dpy, VisualIDMask, &vinfo, &count); if (vinfo_list && count > 0) { XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNdepth, vinfo_list[0].depth); ++cnt; XFree ((XPointer) vinfo_list); } } XtDestroyWidget (top); /* * Now create the real toplevel widget. */ XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNargv, xargv); ++cnt; XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNargc, xargc); ++cnt; top = XtAppCreateShell ((char *) NULL, class, applicationShellWidgetClass, dpy, args, cnt); /* * Display the application and loop handling all events. */ XtRealizeWidget (top); XtAppMainLoop (app); return (0); } ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 5. Which visual should an application use? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- This is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is no way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to be specified by the user. If you disagree with this then your application probably falls into the category of always using the default visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular visual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or some such). Why? No application runs in isolation. Depending on the way a server allocates resources I may not always want your application to run in TrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications. I may be very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor or just monochrome. As an example, on a low end color Sun server there are many different possible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, static color, and a 3/3/2 TrueColor. The SGI Iriss offer all the above plus 12 bit TrueColor, 24 bit TrueColor, an Overlay Plane. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 6. Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- This is strictly by convention. It makes it possible for an arbitrary widget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the shell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that shell. A widget can have its own visual resource. If it does, it must have its own realize method to use the visual when it calls XCreateWindow(). You should also make this a resource that can be obtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it. A reasonable value is probably XtNvisual. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 7. Which visual, depth and colormap do Shells inherit? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent. This is interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen(), DefaultDepthOfScreen() and the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e. it is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree. If the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copies colormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the visual. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 8. Ive done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error. Why? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Some resource converters improperly cache references. This was especially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 9. Why doesnt my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- See section 2.8 of the Xt specification. It eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately. The Intrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process. First it and all of its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed. It is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed. This way any pending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned up before the memory is actually freed. The second phase is then performed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions have completed, before checking for the next X event. At this point the list is traversed and each widgets memory is actually free()d, among other things. As some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if the Intrinsics determine that they have no further references to the widgets on the list. If so, then the phase 2 destruction occurs immediately. Also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed on the destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not destroyed until returning to the outer event loop. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting an application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widget may not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open sockets, temporary files, allocated X resources, etc. (this code for simplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget): Widget ToplevelGet (gw) Widget gw; /* widget to find toplevel */ { Widget top; for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top)) /* empty */; return (top); } void ExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data) Widget gw; /* widget */ XtPointer closure; /* data the app specified */ XtPointer call_data; /* widget specific data */ { Widget toplevel; toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw); XtUnmapWidget (toplevel); /* make it disappear quickly */ XtDestroyWidget (toplevel); exit (0); } One can see that the above code exits immediately after destroying the toplevel widget. The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never occur. This works for most widgets and most applications but will not work for those widgets that have any external state. You might think that since it works now it will always work but remember that part of the reason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant of the implementation details for each widget. Which means that the widget may change and someday require that some external state is cleaned up by the Destroy callbacks. One alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag and then test for that flag in a private event loop. However, private event loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, and difficult to maintain practices. Try the following code instead. #include <X11/Intrinsic.h> extern Widget ToplevelGet ( #if NeedFunctionPrototypes Widget gw #endif ); extern Boolean ExitWorkProc ( #if NeedFunctionPrototypes XtPointer closure #endif ); extern void ExitCallback ( #if NeedFunctionPrototypes Widget gw, XtPointer closure, XtPointer call_data #endif ); Widget ToplevelGet (gw) Widget gw; /* widget to find toplevel */ { Widget top; for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top)) /* empty */; return (top); } void ExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data) Widget gw; /* widget */ XtPointer closure; /* data the app specified */ XtPointer call_data; /* widget specific data */ { Widget toplevel; toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw); XtUnmapWidget (toplevel); /* make it disappear quickly */ XtDestroyWidget (toplevel); XtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw), ExitWorkProc, (XtPointer) NULL); } Boolean ExitWorkProc (closure) XtPointer closure; { exit (0); /*NOTREACHED*/ } ExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the application is next idle -- which happens after all the events are processed and the destroy callbacks are executed. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 11. How do I resize a Shell widget? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- After it is realized, one doesnt resize a Shell widget. The proper thing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widget using XtSetValues(). The geometry change is then propagated to the Shell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the request. However, the Shell must have the resource XtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask the window manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize. To change the position of a Shell, use XtSetValues() on the Shell, not the child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 12. Why cant XtAppAddInput() handle files? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- It does, however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file does not fit most peoples intuitive model. In Unix terms a file descriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not block, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to block. This works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes. For a file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF -- i.e. no more data. The result is the code in the Intrinsics always calls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to be read. The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV based OSs it is the poll() system call. How to get around this on a Unix system? The best approach is to use another process to check for available input on the file. Use a pipe to connect the application with this other process and pass the file descriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput(). A suitable program on BSD systems is ""tail -f filename"". Its rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_ reliable. In particular: - IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while (several thousand times) and then stop until some other event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race condition in the Kernel. IBM claims to have a fix for this. - Pyramid, doesnt work at all. - Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as sockets), wasnt completely broken, but although the writing side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at a time. You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks (get raound it by detecting the situation and having select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had been given the whole block). Note that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such as read(), file descriptor, pipes, etc. This is an OS dependent area and may not be identical on all systems. However the Intrinsic designers felt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with part of the toolkit. Why they didnt also deal with signals at this point I dont know. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 13. What good books and magazines are there on Xt? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- I have a favorite that is the definitive reference. To my perspective it offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the full details of the Intrinsics. When I started using it I was already familiar with Xt and the concepts behind it, so newcomers may or may not find it useful. Ive always found it accurate and complete, which means its a 1000 pages. Asente, Paul J., and Swick, Ralph R., ""X Window System Toolkit, The Complete Programmers Guide and Specification"", Digital Press, 1990, ISBN 1-55558-051-3, order number EY-E757E-DP; and by Prentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-972191-6. Also available through DEC Direct at 1-800-DIGITAL. The other book I commonly recomend to novices is: Young, Doug. ""The X Window System: Applications and Programming with Xt (Motif Version),"" Prentice Hall, 1989 (ISBN 0-13-497074-8). (ISBN 0-13-972167-3) And of course OReilly has an entire series of manuals on X and Xt. OReilly ordering is 800-998-9938. In particular, Volume 5 is an Xt reference done in manual page style. The 3rd edition is extensively overhauled and goes far beyond the MIT manual pages. Im finding it very useful. In particular, the permutted index and references to other manual pages help a great deal in chasing down related information. I read two periodicals, ""The X Resource"" and the ""The X Journal"". These are the only two dealing specifically with X. ""The X Resource"" is published quarterly, by OReilly, with one of the issues being the MIT X Consortium Technical Conference Proceedings. There is no advertising. Ive found it informative with pretty good depth. For orders, call 1-800-998-9938, or email For editorial matters, email Table of contents are posted at math.utah.edu in ~ftp/pub/tex/bib in TeX form and on ftp.uu.net in ~ftp/published/oreilly/xresource in ASCII form. ""The X Journal"" is a bimonthly trade rag with lots of advertising. The articles are informative and oriented toward a less technical audience. I read it more to see whats going on then with an expectation of learning a great deal (but remember, I represent a fairly small percentage of people). Also, they have a pretty good collection of people on the advisory board and as columnists. Call (908) 563-9033. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 14. What Widgets are available? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- There are three popular widget sets: Athena - The set provided with X11. This is sufficient for most purposes but is on the ugly side. Recently, a 3d look is available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xaw3d.tar.Z. Motif - From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but Sun). It looks good and works well but personally I think it is poorly implemented. OLIT - The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets implementing Suns Open Look specification. Developed by AT&T. Ive never used it so cant comment on its quality. Ive heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get. In addition the following collection of widgets are also available: Xtra - a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software Technology (310-328-9338). It includes bar graph, stacked bar graph, line graph, pie chart, xy plot, hypertext, help, spreadsheet, and data entry form widgets. Ive never seen them so I cant comment. FWF - The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of freely available widgets. Included are a Pixmap editor, FileDialog, and a few others. The current set of widgets can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z. Xcu - The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes. One of the early widget sets released. Provides a nice appearance for buttons and has a mini command language. Probably not so widely used. Xs - The Sony widget set. This was around during R3 days but seemed to disappear. It looked like it had promise. Xw - The HP widgets. The precursor to Motif. Originally written for R3 there exists diffs to get it to work under R4 & R5. Again, a pretty good widget set but has more or less died. The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was originally implemented for X10R4 and apparently provided much experience for the designers of Xt. Xo - A widget set Im working on. Its still primitive but you can give it a try in archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/Xo/* The following specialized widgets are also available: Tbl - Implements a tabular layout of widgets. Supports Motif widgets as children. Part of Wcl. Plots - The Athena Plotting widgets (not the Athena widgets). Contact or ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 15. What alternatives to the Intrinsics are there? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- __________________________________________ Name Language Vendor __________________________________________ Xview C Sun OI C++ ParcPlace Interviews C++ Stanford Tcl/tk C sprite.berkeley.edu __________________________________________ However much I like C and admire the skill in both designing and implementing the Intrinsics, hopefully some alternative will develop in the next 3-5 years that uses an object oriented language. Keep your eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language other than C _starts_ gaining acceptance. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 16. How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- First, what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially) typdef struct { String name; long value; } Arg; and the code: Arg arg; XtSetArg (arg, ""name"", 3.2) expands to Arg arg; arg.name = ""name""; arg.value = 3.2; you can see that with normal C type conversions, the arg.value gets the integer ""3"" instead of the floating point value ""3.2"". When the value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern is wildly different than that required for a floating point value. So, how to get around this? The following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am now recomending it over the previous suggestions. #define XtSetFloatArg(arg, n, d) \ if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \ XtSetArg(arg, n, &(d)); \ } else { \ XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \ XtSetArg(arg, n, *ld); \ } ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 17. How do I write a resource converter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Courtesy of Rich Thomson The following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5) Intrinsics. Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allow for destructors and caching of converted values. There are several main types of resource converters: string to data type data type to string data type to data type i) string to data type Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings that will be converted to data type values. This is most often used to map enumerated names to enumerated values: Name Value ""True"" 1 ""False"" 0 In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare the resource value to the list of fixed strings. This is most readily accomplished by the use of the ""quark"" mechanism of the resource manager. The resource value is turned into a quark, which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a single word. Then the resource quark is compared against the quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values. If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the resource strings into quarks. That way, the first time one of these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one of the converters. ii) data type to string This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data type converters since the use of quarks isnt necessary. Instead, the data type value is simply converted to a string value, probably by the use of sprintf. Data type to string converters are useful for applications that wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that they can write out a valid resource specification to a file. This mechanism can be used to provide a ""snapshot"" of application state into a file. This snapshot can be used to restore the program to a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms. If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type converter, it isnt much extra effort to write the data type to string converter. Writing both at the same time helps to ensure that they are consistent. iii) data type to data type This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type value to another data type. For instance, an X pixel value can be converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for red, green and blue. The type signature for a resource converter is as follows: typedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display *, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *, XrmValuePtr, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer *); Display *dpy; XrmValuePtr args; Cardinal *num_args; XrmValuePtr fromVal; XrmValuePtr toVal; XtPointer *converter_data; When the converter is invoked, the ""fromVal"" argument points to the source X resource manager value and the ""toVal"" argument points to the destination X resource manager value. The ""converter_data"" argument is an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified when the converter is registered. The ""args"" and ""num_args"" arguments allow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is invoked. For instance, the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussed above would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the Pixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel. Care must be taken with the ""toVal"" argument. An XrmValue has the following type definition and specifies a size and location for a converted value: typedef struct { unsigned int size; caddr_t addr; } XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr; When the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location of the given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL. In the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of the destination area is large enough to handle the converted value. If the destination area is not large enough, then the converter should set the size to the amount of space needed and return False. The caller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the converter. If the size is large enough, then the converter can simply copy the converted value into the space given and return True. If the location is NULL, then the converter can assign the location to the address of a static variable containing the converted value and return True. When writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and it becomes convenient to define a macro: #define DONE(var, type) \ if (toVal->addr) \ { \ if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \ { \ toVal->size = sizeof(type); \ return False; \ } \ else \ *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \ } \ else \ toVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \ toVal->size = sizeof(type); \ return True; #define DONESTR(str) \ if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \ { \ toVal->size = sizeof(String); \ return False; \ } \ else \ toVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \ toVal->size = sizeof(String); \ return True; Inside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safety checking on the ""num_args"" and ""args"" arguments to ensure that your converter is being called properly. Once you have written your converter, you need to register it with the Intrinsics. The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating widgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database. To register a converter with a single application context, use XtAppSetTypeConverter: void XtAppSetTypeConverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args, cache, destructor) XtAppContext context; String from; String to; XtTypeConverter converter; XtConvertArgList args; Cardinal num_args; XtCacheType cache; XtDestructor destructor; To register a converter with all application contexts, use XtSetTypeConverter: void XtSetTypeConverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args, cache, destructor) String from; String to; XtTypeConverter converter; XtConvertArgList args; Cardinal num_args; XtCacheType cache; XtDestructor destructor; In the R3 Intrinsics, there were the routines XtAppAddConverter and XtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverter and XtSetTypeConverter. Whenever possible, the newer routines should be used. When a converter is registered with the Intrinsics, a ""cache"" argument specifies how converted resource values are to be cached: XtCacheNone Dont cache any converted values XtCacheAll Cache all converted values XtCacheByDisplay Cache converted values on a per display basis Caching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a good idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions). The ""destructor"" argument is a routine that is invoked then the resource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count has been decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is being destroyed. XtDestructor has the following type definition: typedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *); XtAppContext context; XrmValuePtr to; XtPointer converter_data; XrmValuePtr args; Cardinal *num_args; The destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated with the ""to"" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointed to by the ""to"" argument itself (to->addr). The destructor is passed the extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the conversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual arguments for the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need to free the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the private data passed in when the converter was registered. Sample converter code can be found in the following files in the MIT R5 distribution: mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 18. How do I open multiple displays? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- See ""Multi-user Application Software Using Xt"", The X Resource, Issue 3, (Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issues involved. Most of this answer is based on that article. In a nutshell, one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_ application context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each display and remove it from the application context. The real problems occur when trying to close down a display. This can happen 3 ways: 1. User selects a ""quit"" button on one of the displays, 2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message, 3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message, server shutdown/crash, or network failure. Ill assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ a problem of translating a Widget to a display and removing that display. If not, then read the Oliver Jones article. The third one is difficult to handle. The following is based on the Oliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficult problem. The difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/O error is always unrecoverable and so fatal. This is essentially true for a single display X based application, but not true for a multiple display program or an application that does things other than display information on an X server. When an X I/O error occurs the I/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit() happens. The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoid returning to the I/O error handler. The following code fragment demonstrates this: #include <setjmp.h> jmp_buf XIOrecover; void XIOHandler (dpy) Display *dpy; { destroyDisplay (dpy); longjmp (XIOrecover, 1); } main () { ... if (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0) XSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler); XtAppMainLoop (app_context); } The destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can go back to the application specific data and perform any necessary cleanup. It should also call XtCloseDisplay(). For those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() is first called it returns a 0 and saves enough information in the jmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to the same state as if the setjmp() was just executed. The return value of this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to longjmp(). There are several caveats about using these but for this purpose it is adequate. Some other problems you might run into are resource converters that improperly cache resources. The most likely symptoms are Xlib errors such as BadColor, BadAtom, or BadFont. There may be problems with the total number of displays you can open since typically only a limited number of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical value. You may also run into authorization problems when trying to connect to a display. There was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in November of 91. Robert Scheifler posted an article which basically said this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 19. What changed from R3 to R4 to R5? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- This addresses only changes in the Intrinsics. First, the general changes for each release are described. Then a, certainly incomplete, list of new functions added and others that are now deprecated are listed. Brevity is a primary goal.

Where are the resources loaded from? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The resources of a widget are filled in from the following places (from highest priority to lowest priority): 1. Args passed at creation time. 2. Command line arguments. 3. Users per host defaults file 4. Users defaults file. 5. Users per application default file. 6. System wide per application default file. Note that 2-6 are read only once on application startup. The result of steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries. The per host defaults file contains customizations for all applications executing on a specific computer. This file is either specified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is not set then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used. The user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGER property on the root window of the display or if that is not set then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used. Typically, the program ""xrdb"" is used to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property. Please note that this should be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the display must transfer the property. A size of around 1-3KByte is reasonable. Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGER but most do not. A user may have many per application default files containing customizations specific to each application. The intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found. Read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found. The system wide per application default files are typically found in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. If such a file is not found then the fallback resources are used. The intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found. Read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found. [Thanks to Oliver Jones for the following, 6/92] You can use several environment variables to control how resources are loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR. These environment variables control where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an application is initializing. Xt loads at most one app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH. Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies. Suppose, for example, that you are running Suns Open Windows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your OPENWINHOME is located): setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames. The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see XtResolvePathname()): %N The value of the filename parameter, or the applications class name. %T The value of the file ""type"". In this case, the literal string ""app-defaults"" %C customization resource (R5 only) %S Suffix. None for app-defaults. %L Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. ""ja_JP.EUC"") %l Language part of %L (e.g. ""ja"") %t The territory part of the displays language string %c The codeset part of the displays language string Lets take apart the example. Suppose the applications class name is ""Myterm"". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.) /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm $OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm As the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above app-defaults files, in the order shown. As soon as it finds one, it reads it and uses it, and stops looking for others. The effect of this path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin. Lets consider another example. This time, lets set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults. setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad. The second expands to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm. This is a convenient setting for debugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file Myterm.ad in the applications source directory, so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly. NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, for some bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and %S are useless. With R5, theres another twist. You may specify a customization resource value. For example, you might run the ""myterm"" application like this: myterm -xrm ""*customization: -color"" If one of your pathname specifications had the value ""/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C"" then the expanded pathname would be ""/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color"" because the %C substitution character takes on the value of the customization resource. The default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is: /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\ (R5) /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\ (R5) /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\ (R5) /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\ /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\ /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N (Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this batch of default settings.) The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is <root>/%L/%N%C:\ (R5) <root>/%l/%N%C:\ (R5) <root>/%N%C:\ (R5) <root>/%L/%N:\ <root>/%l/%N:\ <root>/%N: <root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the users home directory if XAPPLRESDIR is not set. If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether. Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR to ""."", a single dot. In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to ""./"", a dot followed by a slash. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 21. What order are callbacks executed in? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Donna Converse, 5/10/92) The Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order. This is because both the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to modify the entire contents of the callback list. Neither one currently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannot guarantee the order of execution. The application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; the widget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and remove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have; therefore the functionality contained in a callback should be independent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the list. Even though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback says: ""callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the procedure is to be appended."" you may not infer from the word ""appended"" that the callback routines are called in the same order as they have been added to the callback list. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 22. How do I know if a widget is visible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Donna Converse, 5/14/92) > I am building a widget needs to know if it is visible. I set the visible > interest field in Core and if my window is completely obscured, the Core > visible flag goes FALSE. However, if my window is iconified, the flag > stays set to TRUE. Right, everything is implemented correctly. This demonstrates a ""deficiency"" in the X protocol, and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the protocol. (The ""deficiency"" is that the information is available in one way, in this case an inconvenient way.) The Xt specification is accurate, in the second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this section carefully. The visible field will not change in response to iconification. A VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes from viewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped; that is, when iconification occurs. This is the protocol deficiency. Visibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol; see the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual. > Is this a problem with ""mwm"" or is there something > else which needs to be done? Youll see this with any window manager, with no window manager. > If the problem is ""mwm"", what is the fastest > way to determine if a window is iconified? As an application writer, keep track with a global Boolean in an action routine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widget which contains your custom widget. As the custom widget writer, see the map_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes. These are suggestions. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt, i.e. XtReparentWidget()? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You cant. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 24. Why use XtMalloc, XtFree, etc? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Unfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc() tends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL. At best it is handled something like: ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type)) if (!ptr) { perror (""malloc in xyzzy()""); exit (1) } To handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functions XtMalloc(), XtCalloc(), XtNew(), XtNewString() and XtRealloc() which all use the standard C language functions malloc(), calloc() and realloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned. Xt error handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits. In addition, if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer, it uses XtMalloc() to get the initial space. This allows code like: if (!ptr) ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type)); else ptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1)); ++count; to be written as: ptr = XtRealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count); Also, XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument. Generally, Ive found the Xt functions conveniant to use. However, anytime Im allocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions so I can fully recover from not enough memory errors. XtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating a structure or copying a string: struct abc *xyzzy; char *ptr; char *str = ""abcdef""; xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc); /* takes care of type casting */ ptr = XtNewString (str); A strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow an implementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with malloc() and free(). I.e. code such as: char *ptr; ptr = XtMalloc (100); /* ... */ free (ptr); may not work. Personally, Id call any implementation that did this broken and complain to the vendor. A common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a string when they should really be using XmStringFree(). ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 25. How to debug an Xt application? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- First, Id recomend getting ""purify"" from Pure Software. This is a great package for tracing memory problems on Suns. Its a bit pricey at $2750 but Id still recomend it. Excuse the marketing blurb (contact for more info). Purify inserts additional checking instructions directly into the object code produced by existing compilers. These instructions check every memory read and write performed by the program under test and detect several types of access errors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past mallocd bounds, or writing to freed memory. Purify inserts checking logic into all of the code in a program, including third party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies system call interfaces. In addition, Purify tracks memory usage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel adaption of garbage collection techniques. Purifys nearly comprehensive memory access checking slows the target program down typically by a factor of two to five. An alternative package that isnt as pricey ($395 for a Sun), runs on many Unixs and has pretty similar features is ""The SENTINEL Debugging Environment"". This replaces malloc() and several other C library functions to add additional checks. (contact for more info) Next, if you are getting any sort of Xlib error, youll need to run in synchronous mode, easily accomplished with the ""-sync"" command line argument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger. Then set a break point in exit(). This will let you trace back to the original Xlib function being called. If you dont run in synchronous mode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to Xlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from the server are asynchronous. Next, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use the undocumented resource ""xtIdentifyWindows"" or the class resource ""XtDebug"" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window. For example: example% xload -xrm *XtDebug:true & example% xwininfo -tree <click in new xload window> will give the normal information but the widget name and class of each window is included. This can help for checking the location and size of errant widgets. Next, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to test the way a widget manages its children, you can try export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z. This acts as a filter between any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour of both. Its a very clever idea. The most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the application is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from a pulldown menu). The server effectively locks up and youll need to go to another machine and kill the debugger manually. The server locks up because the application being debugged has said no one else can have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped waiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands. Unfortunately you cant give them because all the input is going to your application which is stopped. The best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on your desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment) on one machine, and running the application on the other, possibly using a command sequence like this: othermachine% xhost +thismachine thismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0; thismachine% gdb application # Your favorite debugger. or this: othermachine% xhost +thismachine thismachine% gdb application (gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0 (gdb) run ... I believe CodeCenter, a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a method of dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions to release any grabs during breakpoints. Debugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and knowledge of how widgets work. You can go a long way without knowing the internals of a particular widget but not very far without understanding how a widget works. Judicious use of conditional breakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great deal. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 26. Why dont XtAddInput(), XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput, XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly. I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works perfect, but in my ""real"" application nothing happens. The introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted those routines (see Q19 for other changes in R3, R4, and R5). What happens is they use a default application context different then the one you may have created. Since events and timeouts are distributed on a per application context basis and you are using two application contexts, you wont get those events. For example: ... cnt = 0; toplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app, class, Desc, XtNumber (Desc), &argc, argv, Fallback, args, cnt); XtAddTimeOut (...) XtAddWorkProc (...) XtAppMainLoop (app) would never invoke the timeout. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Roger Reynolds, 19 Feb 93) Drag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an ``intuitive fashion. Motif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, OpenLook has supported d-n-d all along. The two protocols are not compatable with each other, and so far as I know, they are not published. I wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible public protocol for doing drag n drop operations between clients. My intention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to support a ""standard"" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop and contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as long as it is based on Xt). The implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCM conventions, for more details read the code. I have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel that it works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff. Also, there seem to be many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motif anyway. The latest RDD (and some other stuff) is available for ftp from netcom.com, in /pub/rogerr. A (possibly older) version is also available on export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib. -- Pete Ware CIS Dept, Ohio State University w/ (614) 292-7318 228 Bolz Hall, 2036 Neil Ave. h/ (614) 538-0965 Columbus, OH 43210 "

The Second Amendment is: > A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security ^^^^^^^ Militia > of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear ^^^^^ State > arms, shall not be infringed. ^^^^ Arms You didnt even get the capitalization correct! Try reading USCA on the Constitution, or get any other CORRECT version of the Constitution. > This mention of a well regulated militia is what confuses me. According > to the Federalist Papers, a well regulated militia has a well defined > structure and follows nationally uniform regulations. Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers!! James Madison, Federalist Paper 46: ""Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments, to which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of. Notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms."" ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434, 8 June 1789: ""The right of the people to keep and bear... arms shall not be infringed. A well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free country..."" Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (on the organization of the militia): ""Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year."" Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (speaking of standing armies): ""... if circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^***** own rights and those of their fellow-citizens."" ***^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ But *surely* Hamilton and Madison didnt mean the PEOPLE when they said ""people"", right? Thats why the Amendment refers to ""the Right of the Militia""?... ;-) > Your average > 17-45 year old male does not fall into the definition. Youre right, the Militia consists of ALL able bodied males (and probably females under current interpretation). > Therefore most > members of The Militia, the one the every gun advocate refers to, are > not members of a well organized militia and therefore are not directly The Amendment does nor refer to ""well organized"", it says ""well regulated"". I have some targets you may examine if you wish to check how _well regulated_ I am. > mentioned in the amendment. > If this amendment wanted to allow every member of The Militia to keep > and bear arms, why did it specificly mention a ""well organized militia"" > in the SAME SENTENCE as the right to keep and bear arms? Correct. Thats why the Right is reserved to the People. And that was to insure the People could form a ""well regulated Militia"", not a ""well organized militia"". > It could be > argued that the first part of the sentence is separate from the last > part. If so, why was it include in the same atomic unit of written What do Atomic Units have to do with this argument? Any moron can set h_bar = C = 1... > instead of a separate sentence? Oh, I see what your question is; Why dont you read the federalist Papers?! James Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the ""General Welfare"" clause): ""Nothing is more natural nor common than first to use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a recital of particulars."" But what does Madison know about the grammatical style of the 2nd? He only wrote it. > The amendment also implies that the right to arms has to due with > the security of a free state. The Federalist Papers mention of a > well regulated militia gives many examples of how this militia protects > the security of a free state. All these examples are actions of a > very organized force, not some John Q. Public with a gun. Thats obviously because youve never actually *read* the Federalist Papers. > All that the Second Amendment clearly states to me is that the peoples > right to form well regulated militias shall not be infringed. That is > people have the right to join a well organized militia. This well > organized militia will, of course, provide training in how to use arms > and in basic military tactics. These training members of the militia > can keep and bear the arms. Cant read, huh? Show me where the document says ""well organized militia"". > Lastly, reading through the Federalist Papers on well organized > militia it is very clear that many of the reasons for these militias. > One reason stated is the protection from a standing army. These days > the standing army could easily defeat a group consisting of every > 17-45 year old male and female not in the armied forces. That is *exactly* why EVERY PERSON should be allowed to own *any* weapon currently in use in the armed forces. > Another > reason stated for well organized militias is to reduced the need > for a standing army.

Maybe its time to re-think > how this should be done and amend the constitution appropriately. Abraham Lincoln, First Inaugural Address, March 4, 1861: ""This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it. Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government, they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it, or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it."" Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, spoken during floor debate over the Second Amendment, I Annals of Congress at 750, 17 August 1789: ""What, Sir, is the use of a militia? It is to prevent the establishment of a standing army, the bane of liberty. ... Whenever Governments mean to invade the rights and liberties of the people, they always attempt to destroy the militia, in order to raise an army upon their ruins."" So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy our Liberties and Rights. -- Charles Scripter * Dept of Physics, Michigan Tech, Houghton, MI 49931 ------------------------------------------------------------- ""...when all government... in little as in great things, shall be drawn to Washington as the centre of all power, it will render powerless the checks provided of one government on another and will become as venal and oppressive as the government from which we separated.""

Well, Ive provided examples to show that the trend was general, and you (or others) have provided some counterexamples, mostly ones surrounding mating practices, etc. I dont think that these few cases are enough to disprove the general trend of natural morality. And, again, the mating practices need to be reexamined... >>Try to find ""immoral"" non-mating-related activities. >So youre excluding mating-related-activities from your ""natural morality""?

And so, by their own choice, they will remain in darkness, sort of like bugs under a rock. However, some people, but not many, will not like the darkness. Sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be comfortable. These people will crawl out from under the rock, and, although blinded at first, will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its warmth.

To render obscure. X b. To darken. 2. To confuse: Their emotions obfuscated X their judgment. [LLat. obfuscare, to darken : ob(intensive) + X Lat. fuscare, to darken < fuscus, dark.] -obfuscation n. X obfuscatory adj. X X GOALS OF THE CONTEST: X X * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below. X * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way. X * To stress C compilers with unusual code. X * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language. X * To provide a safe forum for poor C code. :-) X X The IOCCC is the grandfather of USENET programming contests. Since X 1984, this contest demonstrated that a program that simply works X correctly is not sufficient. The IOCCC has also done much to add X the arcane word obfuscated back into the English language. X (see ""The New Hackers Dictionary"" by Eric Raymond) X X You are strongly encouraged to read the new contest rules before X sending any entries. The rules, and sometimes the contest Email X address itself, change over time. A valid entry one year may X be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules. The typical X start date for contests is in early March. Contest rules are normally not X finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.

12,12.0,0.5117,"car, bike, ride, drive, engine, road, mile, speed, oil, motorcycle","From: (richard welty) Subject: rec.autos: Frequently Asked Consumer/Automotive Questions Keywords: Monthly Posting Reply-To: Organization: New York State Institute for Sebastian Cabot Studies Expires: Thu, 20 May 1993 04:04:03 GMT Lines: 508 Archive-name: rec-autos/part5 [this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly asked automotive questions; the other article contains questions more geared to the automotive enthusiast, and so is not crossposted to misc.consumers. -- rpw] [changes as of 14 April 1993: revised brake fluid section, as non-silicone DOT-5 fluids are now apparently available -- rpw] Commonly Asked Automotive Questions Tire Questions: Q: What do the funny numbers on the sides of my tires mean? A: Typically, you will see something like 195/60HR14. the 195 is the overall width of the tire in millimeters, the tread is usually narrower. The 60 is the `aspect ratio; it indicates the height of the sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width. Our example tire has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm. The 14 is the wheel diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like 390, which is in millimeters. The R means Radial, and the H is a speed rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate. Common speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to 150MPH.) Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice. What follows is a table showing a number of `load indices and corresponding maximum per-tire loads: Load Index 50 51 88 89 112 113 145 149 157 Max Load (Kg) 190 195 560 580 1120 1150 2900 3250 4125 Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table. In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation indicates Passenger car. If no letter is given, then the application of the tire is Passenger car usage. As far as I know, these letters only appear in the US market. The LT designation is prinicipally of interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles. For the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at all. If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78. Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.) There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature, traction, and treadwear. Temperature and Traction are graded A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is a numeric rating. These values are of limited value, as they are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires. Q: My car has tires with a funny size designation: 185/65HR390; can i put normal tires on the car? A: Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin. Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.) You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner, or possibly blow out at high speed.) TRX type tires are becoming hard to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires. Goodyear has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires. Q: Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side of my car? A: Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping is done. The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturers recommendations. Q: How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the car should I put them on? A: In short, 4, and both ends. To explain, many drivers in areas that dont get excessive snow or who dont drive agressively (or at all) in snow conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice. With a rear wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car (a function of the front axle.) In a front wheel drive car, you start, stop, and turn with the front end. The primary risk of putting the snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards. Radar Detectors and Speed Limits: Q: Why arent there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits in this Q&A posting? A: Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless flame wars. If you want to talk about either of these topics, please subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there. Safety Equipment: Q: Do airbags really work? A: Preliminary statistics suggest the following: Airbags work much better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than 3 point belts alone. The con to airbags is that some designs tend to burn the drivers hands when venting the byproducts of the explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but not all) may knock the drivers hands from the wheel, making retention of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult. Brake Questions: Q: Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned? Midas always wants to do this. A: No. There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors more often than is strictly necessary. if the rotors are not warped warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or to turn them. Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped, or badly grooved. Q: They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down. Is this really a good idea? A: It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade prone drum brakes. In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases of long, steep downhill runs. Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings. On the other hand, many standard drivers license tests in the USA still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I suggest that before taking a US drivers test, you either 1) learn to do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a car with an automatic to take the test. Q: How often should I replace my brake fluid? A: Probably more often than you do. Traditional brake fluids tend to absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid. DOT-3 type are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications. The principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling point is important in older brake fluid. DOT-3 fluids have the lowest wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see the next Q&A for more details.) While the requirements imply that DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly competition applications. Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_ improved brake pedal feel. Replacement once a year is recommended for DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid out of the brake calipers fairly regularly. Q: What about DOT-5 brake fluids? A: This breaks down in to two parts. The DOT-5 specification looks excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone based. Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition. Unlike DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all. While this may sound like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring. The water will tend to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where most of the corrosion occurs. Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the brake system when converting to Silicone fluids. Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids: 1) they are difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids. SIlicone fluids may make sense in some street car applications, but they are certainly not recommended for high performance driving applications, and the economics are questionable for street use. I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little information at this time. Q: ABS is available on some of the cars Im looking at, but it costs more. Is it worth it? A: This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons. The short answer is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally work better for the `average driver (that is to say, a driver who does not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques), and may require the `unlearning of some obsolete braking techniques like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case. Now for the long answer. ABS works by monitering the wheels of the car, looking for signs of locked brakes. It may or may not be able be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several systems on the market.) It cannot detect impending lockup (which is what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence of lockup. The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original equipment or OE-equivalent components. When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the system.) If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is achieved.) This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as the system cycles. The percentage of the time that the brakes are truly engaged is called the `duty cycle; typically in an ABS system this is about 40% On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking; on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform threshold braking nearly every time. Unfortunately, on mud and on snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars, has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this eventuality. A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves steering control. This is the case simply because, if you are braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied. Braking distances will lengthen accordingly. An important caution: ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on glare ice, dont expect an ABS system to help you out very much. The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an ABS system in your car. As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential restrictions Ive listed above, you have to worry about the following: 1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for over $1000. Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5 (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles. Because of the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid becomes very important. Q: What about this threshold braking business? A: [normally, Id not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is needed here -- rpw] Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab the pedal and lock em up panic habit entirely, and is much to be prefered. Basically, the premise is that tires generate maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but just before the wheels lock up entirely. Drivers who threshold brake learn to feel what this `threshold feels like, and learn to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake pedal. In many cars, you can feel that you are near the threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it. In any case, if you cant hear the tires whine just a bit, youre not very near the threshold. In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very close to the threshold and theyll probably achieve better stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS take over. Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with ABS systems. The police departments in question quickly blamed the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the involved officers had any recent performance driving training. There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing brake pedal by `pump braking, an old and discredited technique of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system. If you think about it for a minute, youll realize that pump braking must cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least 1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason. Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at the pedal will be sufficient. Gas Questions: Q: Does High Octane gasoline help? A: Maybe, maybe not. Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used. On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your car run well. Check your owners manual for details on what your car needs. Q: My car was made for leaded gasoline. Will unleaded gas hurt it? A: It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear, although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise. The actual increase in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded gasolines actually contain very little lead. You should, however, check your owners manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not actually require leaded gasoline. Q: Do fuel treatments help? What kind should I use? A: Some do and some dont. During the winter, it is a good idea to use dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems. Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection. Manufacturers opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owners manual on your car before using these. Most manufacturers consider 10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline. Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol (Isopropanol), and Petroleum Distillates are fine in fuel injected cars. An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that do the same job. Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything in your gas tank. There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work much, much better. Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1, Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber, and BG 44K. A bottle of one of these, once every six months, is highly recommended. Q: What about detergent gasolines? A: The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this test may advertise that fact. Stickers indicating passage of the test are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations. If such gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional. Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits. Lubrication Questions: Q: What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean? A: There are several different items encoded. There is a two-letter code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such. The S codes are for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine applications. The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE, SE is considered better than SD, and so forth. The more noticeable designation is the oil weight. This is either a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by the letter W (e.g., 10W30.) The latter type is much more commonly used these days, and are the only type that most automobile manufacturers specify in operators manuals. The first number in the designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold; the W stands for `winter. The second number (30) is the viscosity of the oil when hot. There is a trick here; the oil doesnt actually get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter. What is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity of a cold 10 weight oil. as it gets hotter, it doesnt get thin as fast as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil. Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all 30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot. Note also that the novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time. 10W30, 15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though. Q: Are `quick lube places any good? A: Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out there. Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure that they dont overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on your wallet at all times. Q: Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good? A: Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives. Many of these have come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based additives that have been around since the early 50s. PTFE is the chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general, auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products. Most USENET responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are debatable. Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage. Some BMW owners have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of Slick 50 to their cars. This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50 Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as it may clog the oil return passages in the engine. Otherwise, there are no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives. On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world. Q: Do synthetic oils really work? A: Yes, but. More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics, but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by oil manufacturers. Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your car. Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty as conventional oils. Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very effective. Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however. Q: Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals. How often should I change my oil? A: It depends on how you drive. If your car always (or nearly always) gets warmed up, and you dont drive it very hard and keep the revs down, the manufacturers recommendation is probably fine. If, however, you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesnt get up to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often, perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are now specifying 7500 mile intervals.) If you dont drive your car much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change oil every six months anyway. If you are storing a car during the winter, then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out of storage. Misc. Questions: Q: My car has a timing belt. I hear that bad things happen when they break. Whats the story? A: It depends on the internal design of the motor. Early Ford Escorts, for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt. Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be. If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent replacement. Ask your dealer or independent mechanic. Also, ask if there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize, destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage as a side effect. Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water pump can be a costly mistake.) Q: Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it self destructs when the timing belt breaks? A: For performance reasons. Compromising piston design so that the valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance oriented vehicles. Q: What causes Unintended Acceleration? A: The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the same time be consistent with the physical evidence. The NHTSA report goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication by the vehicle operator is probably the cause. -- richard welty 518-393-7228 ``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of a race car about either its pitch or roll axis -- Carroll Smith "

The University cops here (who are >are state cops) are armed better than the Chicago police. It seems most >state cops are. Define ""armed better"". Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the Colt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which faster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the other guys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson in hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting its M-16 now to 3-round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better, but the troops like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful). A revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber. - A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull the trigger again. - A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first, but will fire merely by pulling the trigger. - A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again to rotate to the next round. - A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an easy motion, even one handed. - Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users. - A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often lost as you realize ""hey, its jammed!"" before starting to do anything about clearing it. - Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed of employment as a revolver. - There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of operation of many of them requires more training. Some police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly switching many officers back to the old revolvers. Too many were having accidents, partly due to the poor training they received. Not that Glocks require rocket scientists, but some cops are baffled by something as complex as the timer on a VCR. Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun the police dont know nothing about firearms. Turn off COPS and Hunter and pay attention. I do not seek here to say ""semi-autos are junk"" merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid. A cop with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than equipped for anything short of a riot. Gun control is hitting what you aim at. If you whip out a wonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you dont hit anything. Good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit. I own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon to something like the Ruger Security Six revolver. If I havent hit what Im aiming at in the first 5 shots, something is quite seriously wrong somewheres. While I might like having the backup capacity of those extra shots in certain cases, overwhelmingly the # of shots fired in criminal encounters is less than 5. What do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime? Why the same nice simple .38 revolvers that the police often use. Well actually some police prefer the much heftier .357 Magnum, but anyway..... ObPlea: Dont flame me, I prefer semi-autos for most things. But they introduce unneccessary complications to something as nerve-wracking as an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal. -- ""If everything had gone as planned, everything would have been perfect."" -BATF spokesperson on CNN 3/2/93, regarding failed raid attempt in TX.

The Gaza strip, this tiny area of land with the highest population density in the world, has been cut off from the world for weeks. The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of Gaza, some 700.000 people, by denying them the right to leave the strip and seek work in Israel.

Thats because, among other things, theyve given their > government power to bargain with doctors and hospitals over fees. The difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees. Lack of defensive medicine and near-absence of malpractice is really why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance in Canada (along with France and Germany) without HMOs --- the NYT has admitted that malpractice insurance fees are an order of magnitude lower in Canada but doctors take-home pay is almost equal to American doctors; also, minimal bureaucracy cos the system is so-o-o simple (early March). Part of the deal for using the all-insurance approach like the French and Germans do (hey, why dont they criticize France and Germany? Is it because too many people take French and German in college to make the accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance. Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when the fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctors were just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength rather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socialized medicine approaches like Britains National Health Service. >""`Youve got to remember, youve got a waiting list as well, but its >not as obvious. If youre poor and you dont have insurance, you dont > go to a surgeon. In the States you ration by ability to pay."" For non-life threatening things, market arguments adequately cover why certain procedures are in scarcer demand. I have MD friends who cant make a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurance rates but because they wont get enough customers -- the CMA medical monopolys grip on doctors licencing (as in the US) aside -- so they must move to larger places. However, this does not refute debunking of waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in the U.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. Dennis E. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc. Doug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canadas health insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine. There is one small error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private. >WOULDNT NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE MEAN THAT AMERICANS WHO ARE NOW >FULLY INSURED MIGHT HAVE TO SETTLE FOR LESS? > >In Canada, provincial insurance covers all health costs except dental >care, eyeglasses, prescription drugs, ambulance service, and private >hospital rooms, -- so many Canadians do end up buying some private >insurance. A policy to cover all of these things runs about #40 to $40 >a month. Of course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany case, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public sector. They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra insurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward accomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal benefits, theyll have nothing to do with you if you want to be covered for basic care. At that point, they wouldnt even consider a ""voucher"" approach to broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up the difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff. >****************************************************************** > >WOULDNT FREE CARE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO RUN TO THE DOCTOR FOR EVERY >ACHE AND PAIN? > >People who get free treatment *do* go to the doctor and hospital about >a third more often than those who have to pay a share of their medical >bills. > >Still, Canadians -- who pay nothing at the doctors -- have a lower >per-person health bill than we do. It is ""free"" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two things which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health insurance -- which actually it is). I know that when working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my pay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only annually at income tax time (built into the tax rate). Only fiscal naifs will proclaim that its free, along with the Canadian Left for that is part of their brainwashing agenda. The French do have copayments, though. France Magazines Summer 1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages. For 1-30 days, youre covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward. With extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate. The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance. Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance. So, the other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not gleaned from other taxes. The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure for the U.S. >ISNT THE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY JUST TOO BIG >AND POWERFUL TO KILL? > >Dismantling the health segment of our insurance industry would be >""politically thorny,"" in the quiet words of one advocate for a >national plan. Some 1,200 firms now sell more than $192 billion in >health insurance. Theyd put up a hard fight. Not only has the industry >grown eightfold since Canada shut down its own health insurers, but >our government leaves politicians more open to lobbyists than does >Canadas parliamentary system. Health insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe, its just that it doesnt cover basic care. You can opt out in Canada and Germany, but youll have to go uninsured as a result because there are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market. When private insurance realized how much money theyd make without the risks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe amenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on the fritz in someones private hospital room), they started to pat themselves on the back for their social responsibility. In Quebec last spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against any thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that provinces public health insurance plan. gld -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gary L.

I dont understand the assumption that because something is found to be carcinogenic that ""it would not be legal in the U.S."". I think that naturally occuring substances (excluding ""controlled"" substances) are pretty much unregulated in terms of their use as food, food additives or other ""consumption"". Its only when the chemists concoct (sp?) an ingredient that it falls under FDA regulations. Otherwise, if they really looked closely they would find a reason to ban almost everything. How in the world do you suppose its legal to ""consume"" tobacco products (which probably SHOULD be banned)? Dave Allen Space Science & Engr. Ctr. UW-Madison "

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits. ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20 Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas scintillation proportional counters. CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997. After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturns atmosphere, rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturns satellites, and characterize Titans atmosphere and surface. One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to peer through Titans clouds and determine if there is liquid on the surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere. The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of Saturns satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true nature of Saturns rings.

MAGELLAN - Venus radar mapping mission. Has mapped almost the entire surface at high resolution. Currently (4/93) collecting a global gravity map. MARS OBSERVER - Mars orbiter including 1.5 m/pixel resolution camera. Launched 9/25/92 on a Titan III/TOS booster. MO is currently (4/93) in transit to Mars, arriving on 8/24/93. Operations will start 11/93 for one martian year (687 days). TOPEX/Poseidon - Joint US/French Earth observing satellite, launched 8/10/92 on an Ariane 4 booster. The primary objective of the TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global observations of the sea level for several years, substantially increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean. ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera. Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from that planet by sliding over Jupiters north pole in a gravity-assist manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Suns south pole in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- thats right, a solar-studies spacecraft thats always further from the Sun than the Earth is! While in Jupiters neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992). For gory technical detail, see the many articles in the same issue. OTHER SPACE SCIENCE MISSIONS (note: this is based on a posting by Ron Baalke in 11/89, with ISAS/NASDA information contributed by Yoshiro Yamada Im attempting to track changes based on updated shuttle manifests; corrections and updates are welcome. 1993 Missions o ALEXIS [spring, Pegasus] ALEXIS (Array of Low-Energy X-ray Imaging Sensors) is to perform a wide-field sky survey in the ""soft"" (low-energy) X-ray spectrum. It will scan the entire sky every six months to search for variations in soft-X-ray emission from sources such as white dwarfs, cataclysmic variable stars and flare stars. It will also search nearby space for such exotic objects as isolated neutron stars and gamma-ray bursters. ALEXIS is a project of Los Alamos National Laboratory and is primarily a technology development mission that uses astrophysical sources to demonstrate the technology. Contact project investigator Jeffrey J Bloch for more information. o Wind [Aug, Delta II rocket] Satellite to measure solar wind input to magnetosphere. o Space Radar Lab [Sep, STS-60 SRL-01] Gather radar images of Earths surface. o Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer [Dec, Pegasus rocket] Study of Stratospheric ozone. o SFU (Space Flyer Unit) [ISAS] Conducting space experiments and observations and this can be recovered after it conducts the various scientific and engineering experiments. SFU is to be launched by ISAS and retrieved by the U.S. Space Shuttle on STS-68 in 1994. 1994 o Polar Auroral Plasma Physics [May, Delta II rocket] June, measure solar wind and ions and gases surrounding the Earth. o IML-2 (STS) [NASDA, Jul 1994 IML-02] International Microgravity Laboratory. o ADEOS [NASDA] Advanced Earth Observing Satellite. o MUSES-B (Mu Space Engineering Satellite-B) [ISAS] Conducting research on the precise mechanism of space structure and in-space astronomical observations of electromagnetic waves. 1995 LUNAR-A [ISAS] Elucidating the crust structure and thermal construction of the moons interior.

Helsingius? * * * IDENTITY ======== _____ <1.1> What is `identity on the internet? Generally, today peoples `identity on the internet is primarily determined by their email address in the sense that this is their most unchanging face in the electronic realm. This is your login name qualified by the complete address domain information, for example People see this address when receiving mail or reading USENET posts from you and in other situations where programs record usage. Some obsolete forms of addresses (such as BITNET) still persist. In email messages, additional information on the path that a message takes is prepended to the message received by the recipient. This information identifies the chain of hosts involved in the transmission and is a very accurate trace of its origination. This type of identify-and-forward protocol is also used in the USENET protocol to a lesser extent. Forging these fields requires corrupted mailing software at sites involved in the forwarding and is very uncommon. Not so uncommon is forging the chain at the origination point, so that all initial sites in the list are faked at the time the message is created. Tracing these messages can be difficult or impossible when the initial faked fields are names of real machines and represent real transfer routes. _____ <1.2> Why is identity (un)important on the internet? The concept of identity is closely intertwined with communication, privacy, and security, which in turn are all critical aspects of computer networks. For example, the convenience of communication afforded by email would be impossible without conventions for identification. But there are many potential abuses of identity possible that can have very severe consequences, with massive computer networks at the forefront of the issue, which can potentially either exacerbate or solve these problems. Verifying that an identity is correct is called `authentication, and one classic example of the problems associated with it is H.G.Wells ``War of the Worlds radio broadcast that fooled segments of the population into thinking that an alien invasion was in progress. Hoaxes of this order are not uncommon on Usenet and forged identities makes them more insidious. People and their reputations can be assaulted by forgery. However, the fluidity of identity on the internet is for some one of its most attractive features. Identity is just as useful as it is harmful. A professor might carefully explain a topic until he finds he is talking to an undergraduate. A person of a particular occupation may be able to converse with others who might normally shun him. Some prejudices are erased, but, on the other hand, many prejudices are useful! A scientist might argue he can better evaluate the findings of a paper as a reviewer if he knows more about the authors. Likewise, he may be more likely to reject it based on unfair or irrelevant criteria. On the other side of the connection, the author may find identities of reviewers useful in exerting pressure for acceptance. Identity is especially crucial in establishing and regulating `credit (not necessarily financial) and `ownership and `usage. Many functions in society demand reliable and accurate techniques for identification. Heavy reliance will be placed on digital authentication as global economies become increasingly electronic. Many government functions and services are based on identification, and law enforcement frequently hinges on it. Hence, employees of many government organizations push toward stronger identification structures. But when does identification invade privacy? The growth of the internet is provoking social forces of massive proportions. Decisions made now on issues of identity will affect many future users, especially as the network becomes increasingly global, universal, widespread, and entrenched; and the positive or adverse affects of these actions, intended and inadvertent, will literally be magnified exponentially. _____ <1.3> How does my email address (not) identify me and my background? Your email address may contain information that influences peoples perceptions of your background. The address may `identify you as from a department at a particular university, an employee at a company, or a government worker. It may contain your last name, initials, or cryptic identification codes independent of both. In the US some are based on parts of social security numbers. Others are in the form u2338 where the number is incremented in the order that new users are added to the system. Standard internet addresses also can contain information on your broad geographical location or nationhood. However, none of this information is guaranteed to be correct or be there at all. The fields in the domain qualification of the username are based on rather arbitrary organization, such as (mostly invisible) network cabling distributions. The only point to make is that early fields in the address are more specific (such as specific computer names or local networks) and the later ones the most general (such as continental domains). Typically the first field is the name of the computer receiving mail. Gleaning information from the email address alone is sometimes an inspired art or an inconsistent and futile exercise. (For more information, see the FAQs on email addresses and known geographical distributions below.) However, UNIX utilities exist to aid in the quest (see the question on this). Common Suffixes --------------- .us United States .uk United Kingdom .ca Canada .fi Finland .au Australia .edu university or college .com commercial organization .org other (e.g. nonprofit organization) .gov government .mil military site _____ <1.4> How can I find out more about somebody with a given email address? One simple way is to send email to that address, asking. Another way is to send mail to the postmaster at that address (i.e. although the postmasters job is more to help find user IDs of particular people given their real name and solve mail routing problems. The sysadmin (i.e. may also be able to supply information. Users with related email address may have information. However, all of these methods rely on the time and patience of others so use them minimally. One of the most basic tools for determining identity over the internet is the UNIX utility finger. The basic syntax is: finger This utility uses communication protocols to query the computer named in the address for information on the user named. The response is generated completely by the receiving computer and may be in any format. Possible responses are as follows: - A message `unknown host meaning some aspect of the address is incorrect, two lines with no information and ???. - A message In real life: ??? in which case the receiving computer could not find any kind of a match on the username. The finger utility may return this response in other situations. - A listing of information associated with multiple users. Some computers will search only for matching user IDs, others will attempt to find the username you specified as a substring of all actual full names of users kept in a local database. At some sites finger can be used to get a list of all users on the system with a `finger In general this is often considered weak security, however, because `attackers know valid user IDs to `crack passwords. More information on the fields returned by `finger is given below. More information on `finger and locating peoples email addresses is given in the email FAQ (such as the WHOIS lookup utility). Just as you can use these means to find out about others, they can use them to find out about you. You can `finger yourself to find out what is publicly reported by your UNIX system about you. Be careful when modifying `finger data; virtually anyone with internet access worldwide can query this information. In one amazing case, the New York Times writer J. Markoff uncovered the identity of R. Morris, author of the Internet Worm, through the use of an anonymous tip and finger. See the book Cyberspace by K. Hafner and J. Markoff. _____ <1.5> Why is identification (un)stable on the internet? Generally, identity is an amorphous and almost nonexistent concept on the Internet for a variety of reasons. One is the inherent fluidity of `cyberspace where people emerge and submerge frequently, and absences are not readily noted in the `community. Most people remember faces and voices, the primary means of casual identification in the real world. The arbitary and cryptic sequences of letters and digits comprising most email addresses are not particularly noticeable or memorable and far from a unique identification of an individual, who may use multiple accounts on multiple machines anywhere in the world. Currently internet users do not really have any great assurances that the messages in email and USENET are from who they appear to be. A persons mailing address is far from an identification of an individual. - Anyone with access to the account, e.g. they know the password, either legitimately or otherwise, can send mail with that address in the From: line. - Email addresses for an individual tend to change frequently as they switch jobs or make moves inside their organizations. - As part of current mailing protocol standards, forging the From: line in mail messages is a fairly trivial operation for many hackers. The status and path information prepended to messages by intermediate hosts is generally unforgeable. In general, while possible, forgeries are fairly rare on most newsgroups and in email. Besides these pathological cases abve there are many basic problems with todays internet protocols affecting identification on the internet: - Internet mail standards, described in RFC-822, are still evolving rapidly and not entirely orderly. For example, standards for mail address `munging or `parsing tend to vary slightly between sites and frequently mean the difference between finding addresses and bouncing mail. - Domain names and computer names are frequently changed at sites, and there are delays in the propagation of this data. - Addresses cannot be resolved when certain critical computers crash, such as the receiving computer or other computers involved in resolving names into addresses called `nameservers. - A whole slew of problems is associated with `nameservers; if they are not updated they will not find name addresses, and even the operation of what constitutes `updating has different interpretations at different sites. The current internet mailing and addressing protocols are slightly anachronistic in that they were created when the network was somewhat obscure and not widespread, with only a fraction of the traffic it now sees. Today a large proportion of internet traffic is email, comprising millions of messages. _____ <1.6> What is the future of identification on the internet? Some new technologies and standards are introducing facial images and voice messages into mail and these will improve the sense of community that comes from the familiarity of identification. However, they are not currently widespread, require large amounts of data transfer, standardized software, and make some compromises in privacy. Promising new cryptographic techniques may make digital signatures and digital authentication common (see below). Also, the trend in USENET standards is toward greater authentication of posted information. On the other hand, advances in ensuring anonymity (such as remailers) are forthcoming. See below. PRIVACY ======= _____ <2.1> What is `privacy on the internet? Generally, while `privacy has multiple connotations in society and perhaps even more on the internet, in cyberspace most take it to mean that you have exclusive use and access to your account and the data stored on and and directed to it (such as email), and you do not encounter arbitrary restrictions or searches. In other words, others may obtain data associated with your account, but not without your permission. These ideas are probably both fairly limiting and liberal in their scope in what most internet users consider their private domains. Some users dont expect or want any privacy, some expect and demand it. _____ <2.2> Why is privacy (un)important on the internet? This is a somewhat debatable and inflammatory topic, arousing passionate opinions. On the internet, some take privacy for granted and are rudely surprised to find it tenuous or nonexistent. Most governments have rules that protect privacy (such as the illegal search and seizure clause of the U.S. constitution, adopted by others) but have many that are antithetical to it (such as laws prohibiting secret communications or allowing wiretapping). These rules generally carry over to the internet with few specific rules governing it. However, the legal repercussions of the global internet are still largely unknown and untested (i.e. no strong legal precedents and court cases). The fact that internet traffic frequently passes past international boundaries, and is not centrally managed, significantly complicates and strongly discourages its regulation. _____ <2.3> How (in)secure are internet networks? - `Theoretically people at any site in the chain of sites with access to hardware and network media that transmits data over the Internet could potentially monitor or archive it. However, the sheer volume and general noise inherent to this data makes these scenarios highly improbable, even by government agencies with supposedly vast funding and resources. - Technologies exist to `tap magnetic fields given off by electrical wires without detection. Less obscurely, any machine with a network connection is a potential station for traffic detection, but this scenario requires knowledge and access to very low-level hardware (the network card) to pursue, if even possible. - A company Network General Inc. is one of many that manufactures and markets sophisticated network monitoring tools that can filter and read packets by arbitrary criteria for troubleshooting purposes, but the cost of this type of device is prohibitive for casual use. Known instances of the above types of security breaches at a major scale (such as at network hubs) are very rare. The greatest risks tend to emerge locally. Note that all these approaches are almost completely defused with the use of cryptography. _____ <2.4> How (in)secure is my account? By default, not very. There are a multitude of factors that may reinforce or compromise aspects of your privacy on the internet. First, your account must be secure from other users. The universal system is to use a password, but if it is `weak (i.e. easy to guess) this security is significantly diminished. Somewhat surprisingly and frighteningly to some, certain users of the system, particularly the administrator, generally have unlimited access regardless of passwords, and may grant that access to others. This means that they may read any file in your account without detection. Furthermore, not universally known, most UNIX systems keep fairly extensive accounting records of when and where you logged in, what commands you execute, and when they are executed (in fact, login information is usually public). Most features of this `auditing or `process accounting information are enabled by default after the initial installation and the system administrator may customize it to strengthen or weaken it to satisfy performance or privacy aims. This information is frequently consulted for troubleshooting purposes and may otherwise be ignored. This data tracks unsuccessful login attempts and other suspicious activities on the system. A traditional part of the UNIX system that tracks user commands is easily circumvented by the user with the use of symbolic links (described in man ln). UNIX implementations vary widely particularly in tracking features and new sophisticated mechanisms are introduced by companies regularly. Typically system adminstrators augment the basic UNIX functionality with public-domain programs and locally-developed tools for monitoring, and use them only to isolate `suspicious activity as it arises (e.g. remote accesses to the passwd file, incorrect login attempts, remote connection attempts, etc.). Generally, you should expect little privacy on your account for various reasons: - Potentially, every keystroke you type could be intercepted by someone else. - System administrators make extensive backups that are completely invisible to users which may record the states of an account over many weeks. - Erased files can, under many operating systems, be undeleted. - Most automated services keep logs of use for troubleshooting or otherwise; for example FTP sites usually log the commands and record the domain originations of users, including anonymous ones. - Some software exacerbates these problems. See the section on ``X Windows (in)security. Indepedent of malevolent administrators are fellow users, a much more commonly harmful threat. There are multiple ways to help ensure that your account will not be accessed by others, and compromises can often be traced to failures in these guidelines: - Choose a secure password. Change it periodically. - Make sure to logout always. - Do not leave a machine unattended for long. - Make sure no one watches you when you type your password. - Avoid password references in email. - Be conservative in the use of the .rhost file. - Use utilities like `xlock to protect a station, but be considerate. Be wary of situations where you think you should supply your password. There are only several basic situations where UNIX prompts you for a password: when you are logging in to a system or changing your password. Situations can arise in which prompts for passwords are forged by other users, especially in cases where you are talking to them (such as Internet Relay Chat). Also, be aware that forged login screens are one method to illegitimately obtain passwords. (Thanks to Jim Mattson for contributions here.) _____ <2.5> How (in)secure are my files and directories? The most important privacy considerations are related to file rights, and many lapses can be traced to their misunderstood nature or haphazard maintenance. Be aware of the rights associated with your files and directories in UNIX. If the `x (`execute) right on your parent directory is off for users, groups, and other, these users cannot gain information on anything in your directories. Anything less may allow others to read, change, or even delete files in your home directory. The rights on a directory supersede the rights associated with files in that directory. For a directory, x means that access to the files (or subdirectories) in the directory is possible -- if you know their names. To list the contents of the directory, however, requires the r right. By default most accounts are accessable only to the owner, but the initial configuration varies between sites based on administrator preference. The default file mode specifies the initial rights associated with newly created files, and can be set in the shell with `umask. The details of rights implementations tend to vary between versions of UNIX. Consult man pages on `chmod and `ls. Examples -------- traver.lance % ls -ld ~ drwx------ 15 ld231782 1536 Jan 31 21:22 /users/ld231782/ Here is a listing of the rights associated with a users home directory, denoted by `~. The columns at the left identify what rights are available. The first column identifies the entry as a directory, and the next three columns mean that read, write, and execute rights, respectively, are permitted for that user. For directories, the `x right means that contents (file and subdirectory names) within that directory can be listed. The subsequent columns indicate that no other users have any rights to anything in the directory tree originating at that point. They cant even `see any lower files or subdirectories; the hierarchy is completely invisible to them. traver.lance % ls -l msg -rw-r--r-- 1 ld231782 35661 Jan 29 23:13 msg traver.lance % chmod u=rw,g=,o= msg traver.lance % ls -l msg -rw------- 1 ld231782 35661 Jan 29 23:13 msg Here the modes on the file `msg were changed to take away rights from `group and `other. Note that `ls -l <file> requires both the r right to get the list of files and subdirectories, and the x right to access the files and subdirectories in order to get their size, etc. For example, suppose the directory `foo has rights dr--r--r--, the following is possible: ls foo These commands would fail independent of file rights: ls -l foo ls -l foo/file cat foo/file cd foo If the directory `foo has rights d--x--x--x, the following are possible if it is known beforehand that `foo contains an r readable file named `file: ls -l foo/file cat foo/file cd foo The following commands fail: ls foo ls -l foo (Thanks to Uwe Waldmann for contributions here.) _____ <2.6> How (in)secure is X Windows? X Windows is the primary software developed by the MIT Athena project which is funded by U.S. government grants to develop applications to harness the power of networks in enhancing computational tasks, particularly the human-computer interface. The software implements a client-server interface to a computer via graphical windows. In this case the `client is the application requesting or utilizing graphical resources (such as windows or a mouse) and the `server is the machine that provides them. In many situations the client is an application program running on the same machine as the server. The great utility of X Windows comes from its complete dissociation of the client and server so that windows may be `broadcast to a server at a remote location from the client. Unfortunately this dynamic power also introduces many deep, intricate, and complicated security considerations. The primary security and privacy issue associated with X Windows is that much more sensitive data may be sent over a network, and over wider regions, than in the case where the human is situated near the host computer. Currently there is no encryption of data such as screen updates and keystrokes in X Windows. Due to either intentional design decisions or unintentional design flaws, early versions of the X Window system are extremely insecure. Anyone with an account on the server machine can disrupt that display or read it electronically based on access to the device unix:0.0 by any regular user. There are no protections from this type of access in these versions. The problem arises because the security is completely based on machine addresses rather than users, such that any user at a `trusted machine is himself trusted. Quoting from X documentation (man Xsecurity): > Any client on a host in the host access control list is allowed > access to the X server. This system can work reasonably well in > an environment where everyone trusts everyone, or when only a > single person can log into a given machine...This system does not > work well when multiple people can log in to a single machine and > mutual trust does not exist. With the access control list, the `xhost command may prevent some naive attempts (i.e. those other than the direct-access unix:0.0 evasion); the syntax as typed on the host machine is ``xhost +[name] where [name] is the domain name or internet address of an authorized client machine. By default clients running nonlocal to the host are disabled. Public domain programs to disrupt a display momentarily (such as flip or slowly mirror the screen image, or cause pixels to melt down to the bottom) have been circulating on the internet among hackers for several years and played as pranks on unsuspecting or inexperienced users. Much more serious security breaches are conceivable from similar mechanisms exploiting this inherent weaknesses. (The minimal, easily-bypassed `trusted security mode of `xhost has been jokingly referred to as ``X Hanging Open, Security Terrible.). New versions of the X Window system (X11R5 and higher) by default make server access as secure as the file system using a .Xauthority file and magic cookies. Remote machines must have a code in the .Xauthority file in the home directory that matches the code allowed by the server. Many older programs and even new vendor-supplied code does not support or is incompatible with `magic cookies. The basic magic cookie mechanism is vulnerable to monitoring techniques described earlier because no encryption of keys occurs in transmission. X11R5 also includes other sophisticated encryption mechanisms. Try `man Xsecurity to find out what is supported at your site. Even though improved security mechanisms have been available in X Windows since ~1990, local sites often update this software infrequently because installation is extremely complex. (Thanks to Marc Vanheyningen Jim Mattson and Bill Marshall for contributions here.) _____ <2.7> How (in)secure is my email? By default, not very. The characters that you are reading are almost certainly encoded in ASCII, the American Standard Code for Information Interchange that maps alphabetic and symbolic characters onto numeric codes and vice versa. Virtually every computer system uses this code, and if not, has ways of converting to and from it. When you write a mail message, by default it is being sent in ASCII, and since the standard is virtually universal, there is no intrinsic privacy. Despite milleniums worth of accumulated cryptographic knowledge, cryptographic technologies are only recently being established that afford high priority to privacy as a primary criteria in computer and network design. Some potential pitfalls in privacy are as follows: - The most serious threats are instances of immature or unscrupulous system operators reading private mail in the `spool files at a local site (i.e. at the source or destination of the message), such as a university. - System administrators may also release files to law enforcement agencies, but conventions and protocols for warrants involving computer searches have still not been strongly established and tested legally. - Note that bounced messages go to postmasters at a given site in their entirety. This means that if you address mail with an incorrect address it has a good chance of being seen by a human other than the recipient. - Typically new user accounts are always set up such that the local mail directory is private, but this is not guaranteed and can be overridden. - Finally, be aware that some mailing lists (email addresses of everyone on a list) are actually publicly accessable via mail routing software mechanisms. This `feature can be disabled. Most potential compromises in email privacy can be thoroughly avoided with the use of strong end-to-end cryptography, which has its own set of caveats (for example, unscrupulous administrators may still be a threat if the encryption site is shared or nonlocal). See the sections on ``email privacy and ``email policies. _____ <2.8> How am I (not) liable for my email and postings? As punishment or whatever, your system administrator can revoke certain `privileges such as emailing, USENET posting or reading certain groups, file transferring, remote communications, or generally any subset of capabilities available from your account. This all is completely at the discretion of the local administrator and under the procedures followed at a particular site, which in many cases are haphazard and crisis-oriented. Currently there are virtually no widespread, uniform guidelines or procedures for restricting use to any internet services, and local administrators are free to make arbitrary decisions on access. Today punitive measures are regularly applied in various situations. In the typical scenario complaint(s) reach a system adminstrator regarding abuses by a user, usually but not necessarily preceded by complaints to the user in email, regarding that persons objectionable email or postings. `abusive posters to USENET are usually first given admonitions from their system administrators as urged by others on the `net. (The debate persists endlessly on many newsgroups whether this is also used as a questionable means of attacking or silencing `harmless crackpots or censoring unpopular opinions.) System administrators at remote sites regularly cooperate to squelch severe cases of abuse. In general, however, by tradition Usenet readers are remarkably tolerant of diverse views and uses of the system, but a colorful vocabularly of slang helps describe their alternatives when this patience is sapped: the options wielded by the individual user are to simply advance to the next message (referred to as ``hitting the `n key), or to `plonk annoying posters (according to the Hackers Dictionary, the sound a jerk makes at the end of a fall to the bottom of a kill file). In cases where punitive actions are applied, generally system administrators are least likely to restrict email. USENET postings are much more commonly restricted, either to individual users or entire groups (such as a university campus). Restrictions are most commonly associated with the following `abuses: - harassing or threatening notes, `email terrorism - illegal uses, e.g. piracy or propagation of copyrighted material - `ad hominem attacks, i.e. insulting the reputation of the poster instead of citing the content of the message - intentional or extreme vulgarity and offensiveness - inappropriate postings, esp. binary files in regular groups `mail-bombing: inundating mail boxes with numerous or massive files Major problems originate from lack of distinctions in private and official email or postings. Most users have internet access via accounts at businesses or universities and their activities on the internet can be construed as representative of their parent organizations. Many people put disclaimers in their `signatures in an attempt dissociate their identity and activities from parent organizations as a precaution. A recent visible political case involves the privacy of electronic mail written by White House staff members of the Bush administration. Following are some guidelines: - Acquaint yourself with your company or university policy. - If possible, avoid use of your company email address for private communication. - Use a disclaimer. - Keep a low profile (avoid `flamewars or simply dont post). - Avoid posting information that could be construed to be proprietary or `internal. The following references are available from ftp.eff.com (see also the section on ``internet use policies): /pub/academic/banned.1991 /pub/academic/banned.1992 --- Computer material that was banned/challenged in academia in 1991 and 1992 including USENET hierarchies. /pub/academic/cases --- This is an on-line collection of information about specific computers and academic freedom cases. File README is a detailed description of the items in the directory. /pub/academic/faq/netnews.liability --- Notes on university liability for Usenet. _____ <2.9> How do I provide more/less information to others on my identity? The public information of your identity and account is mostly available though the UNIX utility `finger described above. - You have control over most of this information with the utility `chfn, the specifics vary between sites (on some systems use `passwd -f). - You can provide unlimited information in the .plan file which is copied directly to the destination during the fingering. - A technique that works at some sites allows you to find out who is fingering you and even to vary the .plan file sent to them. - Your signature is determined by the environment variable SIGNATURE - USENET signatures are conventionally stored in the .signature file in your home directory. Providing less information on your online identity is more difficult and involved. One approach is to ask your system adminstrator to change or delete information about you (such as your full name). You may be able to obtain access on a public account or one from someone unrelated to you personally. You may be able to remotely login (via modem or otherwise) to computers that you are not physically near. These are tactics for hiding or masking your online activities but nothing is foolproof. Consult man pages on the chmod command and the default file mode. Generally, files on a shared system have good safeguards within the user pool but very little protection is possible from corrupt system administrators. To mask your identity in email or on USENET you can use different accounts. More untraceable are new `anonymous posting and remailing services that are very recently being established. See below. ______ <2.10> Who is my sysadmin? What does s/he know about me? The requirements and screening for getting a system administration job (and thereby access to all information on a system) vary widely between sites and are sometimes frighteningly lax, especially at universities. Many UNIX systems at universities are largely managed by undergraduates with a background in computing and often `hacking. In general, commercial and industrial sites are more strict on qualifications and background, and government sites are extremely strict. The system adminstrator (root user) can monitor what commands you used and at what times. S/he may have a record (backups) of files on your account over a few weeks. S/he can monitor when you send email or post USENET messages, and potentially read either. S/he may have access to records indicating what hosts you are using, both locally and elsewhere. Administrators sometimes employ specialized programs to track `strange or `unusual activity, which can potentially be misused. ______ <2.11> Why is privacy (un)stable on the internet? For the numerous reasons listed above, privacy should not be an expectation with current use of the internet. Furthermore, large parts of the internet are funded by the U.S. NSF (National Science Foundation) which places certain restrictions on its use (such as prohibiting commercial use). Some high-level officials in this and other government agencies may be opposed to emerging techniques to guarantee privacy (such as encryption and anonymous services). Historically the major threats to privacy on the internet have been local. Perhaps the most common example of this are the widespread occurrences of university administrators refusing to carry some portion of USENET newsgroups labelled as `pornographic. The `alternative hierarchy in the USENET system, which has virtually no restrictions on propagation and new group creation, is frequently targeted (although this material may appear anywhere). From the global point of view traffic is generally completely unimpeded on the internet and only the most egregious offenders are pursued. For example, verbatim transcriptions of copyrighted material (such as newspaper or magazine articles) are posted to USENET with regularity without major consequences (some email complaints may ensue). More astonishing to some is that currently significant portions of USENET traffic, and less so internet traffic, is comprised of sexually-explicit digitized images almost entirely originating from copyrighted material (newsgroups such as `alt.sex regularly have the highest traffic). ______ <2.12> What is the future of privacy on the internet? Some argue that the internet currently has an adequate or appropriate level of privacy. Others will argue that as a prototype for future global networks it has woefully inadequate safeguards. The internet is growing to become a completely global, international superhighway for data, and this traffic will inevitably entail data such as voice messages, postal mail, and many other items of extremely personal nature. Computer items that many people consider completely private (such as their local hard drives) will literally be inches from global network connections. Also, sensitive industrial and business information is exchanged over networks currently and this volume may conceivably merge with the internet. Most would agree that, for these basic but sensitive uses of the internet, no significant mechanisms are currently in place to ensure much privacy. New standards are calling for uniform introduction of `privacy enhanced mail (PEM) which uses encryption technologies to ensure privacy, so that privacy protection is automatic, and may significantly improve safeguards. The same technology that can be extremely destructive to privacy (such as with surreptitious surveilance) can be overwhelmingly effective in protecting it (e.g. with encryption). Some government agencies are opposed to unlimited privacy in general, and believe that it should lawfully be forfeited in cases of criminal conduct (e.g. court-authorized wiretapping). However, powerful new technologies to protect privacy on computers are becoming increasingly popular, provoking some to say that ``the cat is out of the bag and the ``genie cant be put back in the bottle. In less idiomatic terms, they believe that the spread of strong cryptography is already underway will be socially and technically unstoppable. To date, no feasible system that guarantees both secure communication and government oversight has been proposed (the two goals are largely incompatible). Proposals for ``registration of secret keys (by D. Denning on sci.crypt, for example) have been met with hot controversy at best and ridicule and derision at worst, mainly because of concerns for the right to privacy and objections of inherent feasibility. Electronic privacy issues, and particularly the proper roles of networks and the internet, will foreseeably become highly visible and explosive over the next few years. ANONYMITY ========= _____ <3.1> What is `anonymity on the internet? Simply stated, anonymity is the absence of identity, the ultimate in privacy. However, there are several variations on this simple theme. A person may wish to be consistently identified by a certain pseudonym or `handle and establish a reputation under it in some area, providing pseudo-anonymity. A person may wish to be completely untraceable for a single one-way message (a sort of `hit-and-run). Or, a person may wish to be openly anonymous but carry on a conversation with others (with either known or anonymous identities) via an `anonymous return address. A user may wish to appear as a `regular user but actually be untraceable. Sometimes a user wishes to hide who he is sending mail to (in addition to the message itself). The anonymous item itself may be directed at individuals or groups. A user may wish to access some service and hide all signs of the association. All of these uses are feasible on the internet but are currently tricky to carry out in practice, because of all the tracking mechanisms inherent to operating systems and network protocols. Officials of the NSF and other government agencies may be opposed to any of these uses because of the potential for abuse. Nevertheless, the inherent facelessness of large networks will always guarantee a certain element of anonymity. _____ <3.2> Why is `anonymity (un)important on the internet? Anonymity is another powerful tool that can be beneficial or problematic depending on its use. Arguably absence of identification is important as the presence of it. It may be the case that many strong benefits from electronic anonymity will be discovered that were unforeseen and unpredicted, because true anonymity has been historically very difficult to establish. One can use anonymity to make personal statements to a colleague that would sabotage a relationship if stated openly (such as employer/employee scenarios). One can use it to pass information and evade any threat of direct retribution. For example, `whistleblowers reporting on government abuses (economic, social, or political) can bring issues to light without fear of stigma or retaliation. Sensitive, personal, potentially damaging information is often posted to some USENET groups, a risky situation where anonymity allows conversations to be carried on completely independent of the identities of the participants. Some police departments run phone services that allow anonymous reporting of crimes; such uses would be straightforward on the network. Unfortunately, extortion and harassment become more insidious with assurances of anonymity. _____ <3.3> How can anonymity be protected on the internet? The chief means, as alluded to above, are masking identities in email and posting. However, anonymous accounts (public accounts as accessable and anonymous as e.g. public telephones) may be effective as well, but this use is generally not officially supported and even discouraged by some system adminstrators and NSF guidelines. The nonuniformity in the requirements of obtaining accounts at different sites and institutions makes anonymous accounts generally difficult to obtain to the public at large. Many communications protocols are inherently detrimental to anonymity. Virtually every protocol in existence currently contains information on both sender and receiver in every packet. New communications protocols will likely develop that guarantee much higher degrees of secure anonymous communication. _____ <3.4> What is `anonymous mail? One approach to `anonymizing mail has been to set up an `anonymous server that, when activated by email to its address, responds by allocating and supplying an `anonymous ID that is unique to the person requesting it (based on his email address). This will vary for the same person for different machine address email originations. To send anonymous mail, the user sends email directed to the server containing the final destination. The server `anonymizes the message by stripping of identification information and forwards the message, which appears to originate from the anonymous server only from the corresponding anonymous user id. This is the `interactive use of anonymity or pseudonymity mentioned above. Another more `fringe approach is to run a `cypherpunk remailer from a regular user account (no root system privileges are required). These are currently being pioneered by Eric Hughes and Hal Finney The operator runs a process on a machine that anonymizes mail sent to him with certain characteristics that distinguish it from his regular incoming mail (typically fields in the header). One has been implemented as a PERL script running on UNIX. Several of these are in existence currently but sites and software currently are highly unstable; they may be in operation outside of system administrator knowledge. The remailers dont generally support anonymous return addresses. Mail that is incorrectly addressed is received by the operator. Generally the user of the remailer has to disavow any responsibility for the messages forwarded through his system, although actually may be held liable regardless. These approaches have several serious disadvantages and weaknesses: - The anonymous server approach requires maintaining a mapping of anonymous IDs to real addresses that must be maintained indefinitely. One alternative is to allow `deallocation of aliases at the request of the user, but this has not been implemented yet. - Although an unlikely scenario, traffic to any of these sites could conceivably be monitored from the `outside, necessitating the use of cryptography for basic protection,. - Local administrators can shut them down either out of caprice or under pressure from local, network, or government agencies. - Unscrupulous providers of the services can monitor the traffic that goes through them. - Most remailers currently keep logs that may be inspected. - The cypherpunk approach tends to be highly unstable because these operators are basically network users who do not own the equipment and are accountable to their own system administrators, who may be unaware of the use and unsympathetic to the philosophy of anonymity when the operation is discovered, regarding it as illicit use. - In all cases, a high degree of trust is placed in the anonymous server operator by the user. Currently the most direct route to anonymity involves using SMTP protocols to submit a message directly to a server with arbitrary field information. This practice, not uncommon to hackers, and the approach used by remailers, is generally viewed with hostility by most system administrators. Information in the header routing data and logs of network port connection information may be retained that can be used to track the originating site. In practice, this is generally infeasible and rarely carried out. Some administrators on the network will contact local administrators to request a message be tracked and its writer admonished or punished more severely (such as revoking the account), all of this actually happening occasionally but infrequently. See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites and ``responsibilities associated with anonymity. _____ <3.5> What is `anonymous posting? Anonymous servers have been established as well for anonymous Usenet posting with all the associated caveats above (monitored traffic, capricious or risky local circumstances, logging). Make sure to test the system at least once by e.g. anonymous posting to misc.test (however some operators dont recommend this because many sites `autorespond to test messages, possibly causing the anonymous server to allocate anonymous IDs for those machines). See the ``responsibilties associated with anonymous posting before proceeding. Another direct route involves using NNTP protocols to submit a message directly to a newserver with arbitrary field information. This practice, not uncommon to hackers, is also generally viewed with hostility by most system administrators, and similar consequences can ensue. See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites and ``responsibilities associated with anonymity. _____ <3.6> Why is anonymity (un)stable on the internet? As noted, many factors compromise the anonymity currently available to the general internet community, and these services should be used with great caution. To summarize, the technology is in its infancy and current approaches are unrefined, unreliable, and not completely trustworthy. No standards have been established and troubling situations of loss of anonymity and bugs in the software are prevalent. Here are some encountered and potential bugs: - One anonymous remailer reallocated already allocated anonymous return addresses. - Others passed signature information embedded in messages unaltered. - Address resolution problems resulting in anonymized mail bounced to a remailer are common. - Forgeries to the anonymous server itself are a problem, possibly allowing unauthorized users to potentially glean anon ID - email address mappings in the alias file. This can be remedied with the use of passwords. - Infinite mail loops are possible with chaining remailers. Source code is being distributed, tested, and refined for these systems, but standards are progressing slowly and weakly. The field is not likely to improve considerably without official endorsement and action by network agencies. The whole idea is essentially still in its infancy and viewed with suspicion and distrust by many on the internet, seen as illegitimate or favorable to criminality. The major objection to anonymity over regular internet use is the perceived lack of accountability to system operators, i.e. invulnerability to account restrictions resulting from outside complaints. System adminstrators at some sites have threatened to filter anonymous news postings generated by the prominent servers from their redistribution flows. This may only have the effect of encouraging server operators to create less characteristically detectable headers. Probably the least problematic approach, and the most traditional to Usenet, is for individual users to deal with anonymous mail however they prefer, e.g. ignoring it or filtering it with kill files. _____ <3.7> What is the future of anonymity on the internet? New anonymous protocols effectively serve to significantly increase safeguards of anonymity. For example, the same mechanism that routes email over multiple hosts, thereby threatening its privacy, can also be used to guarantee it. In a scheme called `chaining an anonymous message is passed through multiple anonymous servers before reaching a destination. In this way generally multiple links of the chain have to be `broken for security to be compromised. Re-encryption at each link makes this scenario even more unlikely. Even more significantly the anonymous remailers could be spread over the internet globally so that local weaknesses (such as corrupt governments or legal wiretapping within a nation) would be more unlikely to sacrifice overall security by message tracing. However, remailers run by corrupt operators are possible. The future of anonymous services on the internet is, at this time, highly uncertain and fraught with peril. While specific groups seem to benefit significantly from anonymous posting capabilities, many feel that unlimited newsgroup scope for anonymous posting is a disruptive and dangerous idea and detracts from discussions in `serious groups. The introduction of unlimited group anonymity may have fundamental repercussions on Usenet conventions and distribution mechanisms such as moderated and `alt groups have had in the past. For example, as part of new group creation, the charter may specify whether `anonymous posting is (un)welcome. Nevertheless, the widespread introduction and use of anonymity may be inevitable. Based on traffic statistics, anonymous services are in huge demand. Pervasive and readily available anonymity could carry significant and unforeseen social consequences. However, if its use is continued to be generally regarded as subversive it may be confined to the underground. The ramifications of widespread introduction of anonymity to Usenet are still largely unknown. It is unclear whether it will provoke signficant amounts of new traffic or, instead of expansion, cause a shift where a greater portion of existing traffic is anonymized. Conceivably the services could play a role in influencing future mainstream social acceptance of Usenet. * * * This is Part 1 of the Privacy & Anonymity FAQ, obtained via anonymous FTP to or newsgroups news.answers, sci.answers, alt.answers every 21 days.

They are news because they are the exceptions. And the Islamic Holocaust is much the topic of the day. The historical evidence proves that during the period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religion and national origin. Armenians perpetrated acts of sabotage, destroyed telephone cables, blew up bridges, blocked passes, set up ambushes, attacked security stations and small Turkish outposts behind the Ottoman Army lines on the one hand, and on the other ruthlessly attacked Turkish and Kurdish villages, slaughtering the Turkish population indiscriminately, women, children, old and young alike. Innocent Muslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death, or massacred with axes and swords, or else shut up in mosques or in schools and then burnt alive as can be seen below. Widespread Armenian massacres of innocent Muslims took place in regions of Van, Kars, Sivas, Erzurum, Bitlis, Erzincan, Mus, Diyarbakir and Maras. The Ottoman Army, while fighting to prevent the Russian invasion, also had to deal with Armenian genocide squads who cowardly hit from behind. The Armenian genocide of the Muslims spread to all parts of Eastern Anatolia. Starting from late 1914, Armenians committed widespread massacres and genocide in Eastern Anatolia, because the arena was left to the Armenians. Almost every Turkish town and village from Erzincan up to Azerbaidjan suffered large scale massacres and genocide by Armenians and the Turkish genocide has been documented by Armenian, Russian, American, British, Ottoman, German, Austrian and French journalists and officers who observed the first genocide of this century committed by the blood-thirsty Armenian genocide squads. The Ottoman Army, liberating Trabzon, Bayburt, Erzincan, Erzurum, Kars and other regions from the Russians, saw that the cities and their villages had been destroyed and burnt, people slaughtered, massacred. The massacres conducted by Armenians, which became a black stain for humanity, shocked and disgusted even the Russian, British, German, Austrian, French and American authorities. Almost every Ottoman document is related to Armenian massacres and cruelties. The inhuman treatment, cruelties, atrocities, genocide by Armenian genocide squads perpetrated against innocent Moslem Turkish and Kurdish people, are sufficiently reflected in historical documents. Even today over seventy-five years later, the terrifying screams of the victims of these cruelties can be heard. Source: Documents: Volume I (1919).

""I have been closely following for two weeks the withdrawal of Russians and Armenians from Turkish territories through Armenia. Although two months have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of Armenian gangs, I have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the Armenians at almost every step. All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed. Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly slain are everywhere. According to accounts by those who were able to save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun. They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs. I am now in Erzurum, and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air. Although there are speculations that Armenian gangs murdered Austrian and German prisoners as well, I could not get the supporting evidence in this regard, but there is proof of murdering of Turkish prisoners of war.""

Any three of them must be non-collinear (otherwise all three could not lie on the surface of a sphere) and all four must not be coplaner (otherwise either they cannot all lie on a sphere or they define an infinity of them). A, B and C define a circle. The perpendicular bisectors of AB, BC and CA meet in a point (P, say) which is the centre of this circle. This circle must lie on the surface of the desired sphere. Consider the normal to the plane ABC passing through P. All points on this normal are equidistant from A, B and C and its circle (in fact it is a diameter of the desired sphere). Take the plane containing this normal and D (if D lies on the normal any plane containing the normal will do); this plane is at right angles to the ABC one. Let E be the point (there are normally two of them) on the circumference of the ABC circle which lies in this plane. We need a point Q on the normal such that EQ = DQ. But the intersection of the perpendicular bisector of ED and the normal is such a point (and it exists since D is not in the plane ABC, and so ED is not at right angles to the normal). Algorithm: Is the sphere well defined? (1) Check that A and B are not coincident (=> failure). (2) Find the line AB and check that C does not lie on it (=> failure).

22,22.0,0.5741,"word, christian, church, religion, faith, day, sin, people, speak, scripture","From: (Frank DeCenso, Jr.) Subject: MAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY Organization: Youngstown State/Youngstown Free-Net Lines: 224 [With Franks permission, I have added some information here (and in one case changed the order of his contributions) in order to clarify the historical relationship of the views. My comments are based primarily on William Ruschs historical summary in ""The Trinitarian Controversy"", Fortress. Im going to save this as an FAQ. --clh] MAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY [SECOND CENTURY The writers of the 2nd Cent. are important, because they set up much of the context for the later discussions. Justin Martyr, Aristides, Athenagoras, Tatian, and Theophilus of Antioch are known as the ""Apologists"". Their theology has often been described as ""Logos theology"". Based strongly on wording in John, they took more or less a two-phase approach. Through eternity, the Logos was with the Father, as his mind or thought. This ""immanent Word"" became ""expressed"" as God revealed himself in history, ultimately in Jesus. Thus Jesus full distinction from the Father only became visible in history, though the Logos had been present in God from eternity. Rusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of the final orthodox position, but in a form which is less sophisticated, because it did not have the technical language to properly deal with the eternal plurality in the Godhead. Irenaeus held views somewhat similar to the Apologists. However he was uncomfortable with the two-stage approach. He still viewed God as one personage, with distinctions that did not become fully visible except through his process of self-revelation (the ""economy""). The distinctions are present in his essential nature. Irenaeus emphasized the Holy Spirit more than the Apologists. Irenaeus views should probably be called ""economic trinitarianism"", though that term is normally used (as below) to refer to later developments. THIRD CENTURY --clh] Dynamic Monarchianism Source: Theodotus Adherents: Paul of Samosota, Artemon, Socinus, Modern Unitarians Perception of Gods Essence: The unity of God denotes both oneness of nature and oneness of person. The Son and the Holy Spirit therefore are consubstantial with the Fathers divine essence only as impersonal attributes. The divine dunamis came upon the man Jesus, but he was not God in the strict sense of the word. Perception of Gods Subsistence: The notion of a subsistent God is a palpable impossibility, since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible. The diversity of God is apparent and not real, since the Christ event and the work of the Holy Spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within God, not to a hypostatic union. Asignation of Deity/Eternality: Father: Unique originator of the universe. He is eternal, self-existent, and without beginning or end. Son: A virtuous (but finite) man in whose life God was dynamically present in a unique way; Christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified. Holy Spirit: An impersonal attribute of the Godhead. No deity or eternality is ascribed to the Holy Spirit. Criticism(s): Elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelation concerning the Trinity. Categorically denies the deity of Christ and of the Holy Spirit, thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblical doctrine of salvation. [In summary, this probably best thought of as not being Trinitarianism at all. God is an undifferentiated one. Son and Holy Spirit are seen as simply names for the man Jesus and the grace of God active in the Church. --clh] Modalistic Monarchianism Source: Praxeas Adherents: Noatus, Sabellius, Swedenborg, Scleiermacher, United Pentecostals (Jesus Only) Perception of Gods Essence: The unity of God is ultra-simplex. He is qualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person. This essence may be designated interchangeably as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. They are different names for but identical with the unified, simplex God. The three names are the three modes by which God reveals Himself. Perception of Gods Subsistence: The concept of a subsistent God is erroneous and confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of Gods modalistic manifesting of himself. The paradox of a subsisting ""three in oneness"" is refuted by recognizing that God is not three persons but one person with three different names and corresponding roles following one another like parts of a drama. Asignation of Deity/Eternality: Father: Fully God and fully eternal as the primal mode or manifestation of the only unique and unitary God Son: Full deity/eternality ascribed only in the sense of his being another mode of the one God and identical with his essence. he is the same God manifested in temporal sequence specific to a role (incarnation). Holy Spirit: Eternal God only as the tile designates the phase in which the one God, in temporal sequence, manifested himself pursuant to the role of regeneration and sanctification. Criticism(s): Depersonalizes the Godhead. To compensate for its Trinitarian deficiencies, this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical. Its concept of successive manifestations of the Godhead cannot account for such simultaneous appearances of the three persons as at Christs baptism. [Rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy. There are actually two slightly different groups included: Noetus and his followers, and Sabellius. Noetus was apparently more extreme. Sabellius followed him, and attempted to use some features of economic Trinitarianism to create a more sophisticated view. Unfortunately, information about Sabellius comes from a century later, and there seems to be some confusion between him and Marcellus of Ancyra. --clh] [Ive moved the following description to be with the other third-century views. It originally appeared near the end. --clh] ""Economic"" Trinitarianism Source: Hippolytus, Tertullian Adherents: Various ""neo-economic"" Trinitarians Perception of Gods Essence: The Godhead is characterized by triunity: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are the three manifestations of one identical, indivisible substance. The perfect unity and consubstantiality are especially comprehended in such manifest Triadic deeds as creation and redemption. Perception of Gods Subsistence: Subsistence within the Godhead is articulated by means of such terms as ""distinction"" and ""distribution"" dispelling effectively the notion of separateness or division. Asignation of Deity/Eternality: The equal deity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is clearly elucidated in observation of the simultaneous relational/operational features of the Godhead. Co-eternality, at times, does not intelligibly surface in this ambiguous view, but it seems to be a logical implication. Criticism(s): Is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of the relational aspect of the Trinity. [Note that this is a development of the Apologists and Irenaeus, as mentioned above. As with them, the threeness is visible primarily in the various ways that God revealed himself in history. However they did say that this is a manifestation of a plurality that is somehow present in the Godhead from the beginning. Tertullian talks of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as being three that are one in substance. Many people regard this view as being essentially orthodox, but with less developed philosophical categories. --clh] [Origen, developing further an approach started by Clement, attempted to apply neo-Platonism to Christian thought. He set many of the terms of the coming battle. In Platonic fashion, he sees the Son as a mediator, mediating between the absolute One of God and the plurality of creating beings. The Son is generated, but he is ""eternally generated"". That is, the relationship between Father and Son is eternal. It cannot be said that ""there was once when he was not"" (a phrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries). Having the Son is intrinsic to his concept of God. The Father and Son are described as separate ""hypostases"", though this may not have quite the meaning of separate subsistence that it had in some contexts. The union is one of love and action, but there is some reason to think that he may have used the term homoousios (""of the same substance""). The Holy Spirit is also an active, personal substance, originated by the Father through the Son. Origens intent is trinitarian, not tritheistic, but he pushes things in the direction of separateness. FOURTH CENTURY --clh] Subordinationism [often called Arianism --clh] Source: Arius Major Adherents: Modern Jehovahs Witnesses, and several other lesser known cults Perception of Gods Essence: The inherent oneness of Gods nature is properly identifiable with the Father only. The Son and the Holy Spirit are discreet entities who do not share the divine essence. Perception of Gods Subsistence: The unipersonal essence of God precludes the concept of divine subsistence with a Godhead. ""Threeness in oneness"" is self- contradictory and violates biblical principles of a monotheistic God. Asignation of Deity/Eternality: Father: The only one, unbegotten God who is eternal and without beginning. Son: A created being and therefore not eternal. Though he is to be venerated, he is not of the divine essence. Holy Spirit: A nonpersonal, noneternal emanation of the Father. He is viewed as an influence, an expression of God. Deity is not ascribed to him. Criticism(s): It is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respecting the deity of both Christ and the Holy Spirit. Its hierarchial concept likewise asserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the Father, Christ, and the Holy Spirit. This results in a totally confused soteriology. [Note also that in most versions of this view, the Son is not fully human either. He is supernatural and sinless. That distinguishes this view from adoptionism. --clh] Orthodox Trinitarianism Source: Athanasius Adherents: Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, Contemporary orthodox Christianity Perception of Gods Essence: Gods being is perfectly unified and simplex: of one essence. This essence of deity is held in common by Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The three persons are consubstantial, coinherent, co-equal, and co- eternal. Perception of Gods Subsistence: The divine subsistence is said to occur in three modes of being or hypostases. As such, the Godhead exists ""undivided in divided persons."" This view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperation in function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the Godhead. Asignation of Deity/Eternality: In its final distillation, this view unhesitatingly sets forth Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as co-equal and co-eternal in the Godhead with regard to both the divine essence and function. Criticism(s): The only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent in human language and thought itself: the impossibility of totally describing the ineffable mystery of ""three in oneness."" [At least in the 4th Cent, there were several different approaches, all of which fit the description here, and all regarded as orthodox, but which are somewhat different in detail. Nicea was originally held to respond to Arius. Arius can be thought of as carrying Origens thought a bit too far, to the point of making the Son a separate entity. In general the East tended to take an approach based on Origens, and it was hard to get acceptance of Nicea in the East. Its final acceptance was based on the work of Athanasius with the Cappadocians: Gregory of Nyssa and Gregory of Nazianzus, among others. While starting with three, they show that their unity in nature and and action is such that one must think of them as being a single God. This allowed the Council of Constantinople, in 381, to get wide agreement on the idea of three hypostatese and one ousia. --clh] Adapted from _Charts of Christian Theology and Doctrine_, by H.

A few points need to be clarified: The Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or the metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects. It should never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the normal operating current of a connected load. Some equipment has filters in the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding conductor. Much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages on the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding conductors to provide reliable operation (""orange"" outlets are often used for this, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in many cases back to the service. Anyone installing such a system should read both the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on installing quiet isolated ground systems. The code requires the insulated grounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors back to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service entrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod) Many of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide a safe ground or a quiet ground or either. The GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is referred to in the code as the ""identified"" conductor and is supposed to be white or natural grey. This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in most electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance panel. This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper. (In many household service panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel) The Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor. In the case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the circuit from the panel to the load device. Since the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding conductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance from the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load, under normal operating conditions. If you should (incorrectly) connect the grounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor. Since there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end. If the load equipment has a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the ""U"" ground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential. The difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few tenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two. This normally does not present a shock hazard. HOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator, a metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to flow through this aalternate ground path. If the contact is not solid, you will get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc) Under the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire. It is possible in some cases that the sneak ground current could also flow through a wire of inadequate size, causing it to overheat. With the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a short circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which increases the possibility for shock or fire. Also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often causing malfunction. I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment. The Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as well as at the service entrance of each dwelling. This is done primarily for lightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back to ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses quickly. The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer. Some of it flows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks, and it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop between the ""hot"" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the water pipe and ground. There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy. (dont flame ME on this, Im just telling you where the field comes from, not its health effect, as far as Im concerned, the jury is still out on this.) Note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any sub distribution panels. This is one reason why it is illegal to run service entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral. The sheath can be used in this application only as the groundING conductor. If the neutral is bonded to the grounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding screw, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above ground, with the possible problems listed above. The code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one building to another. In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be used as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate wire. Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review. These exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days before U ground outlets and such. The appliance manufacturers dont want to have to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors dont want to have to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place of three wire to the appliances. No question it would be safer with seperate neutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings (since most current is in the 220 volt ""hots"" except at some low settings, the wires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage. So far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings, its primarily for lightning protection. People doing wiring should be aware what is and what isnt a legal grounding conductor. Obviously, the bare wire in ""romex"" with ground is. Anywhere there is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good grounding conductor. The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes is a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath. You can just cut this aluminum band off at the ends, you dont have to bond it to anything, it does its job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall tubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding locknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes. ""Greenfield"" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty sheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesnt have the aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and inductance. You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the greenfield. ""Wiremold"" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes often prevents good contact, and the ""feed"" to the wiremold extension is often from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold box. I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were ""hot"" with 120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator here in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box. You must run a ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in the original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can ""bond"" the wire to the box with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever. On another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets when ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them without a ground if no ground is available. It is better to have the protection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you dont install it. The interrupter doesnt depend on the ground to trip. It is desirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is connected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in, whereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something provides a ground path. For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded GCFIs, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my 93 code is in the city, but I know the rule hasnt changed. It might be renumbered though.) We have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more to this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.

26,26.0,0.6529,"study, doctor, patient, problem, test, disease, medical, treatment, pain, effect","From: Subject: Candida(yeast) Bloom, Fact or Fiction Lines: 187 Nntp-Posting-Host: vms.ocom.okstate.edu Organization: OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine I can not believe the way this thread on candida(yeast) has progressed. Steve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci. Med. Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did not exist. Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well. Let me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have no idea how the human body interacts with its environment and how that balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics. These are the physicians who dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go from doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) and then when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling quack. Could it just be professional jealousy? I couldnt help Elaine or Jon but somebody else did. Could they know more than Me? No way, they must be a quack. Ive been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten years now and guess who the most receptive students are? Those that were raised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to entering medical school(switched to the vegan diet). Typically, this is about 1/3 of my class of 90 students. Those not interested in nutrition either tune me out or just stop coming to class. Thats okay because I know that some of what Im teaching is going to stick and there will be at least a few ""enlightened"" physicians practicing in the U.S. Its really too bad that most U.S. medical schools dont cover nutrition because if they did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the medical profession. In animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with ""good"" bacteria after antibiotics are stopped. Medicine has decided that since humans do not have a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with ""good"" bacteria is needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic. Humans have all kinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin. These are nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune system is compromised. They are also called nonpathogens because unlike the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body. But any of these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up residence within the body. A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier. Steve got real upset with Elaines doctor because he was using anti-fungals and vitamin A for her GI problems. If Steve really understoood what vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling Elaines doctor a quack. Here is a brief primer on yeast. Yeast infections, as they are commonly called, are not truely caused by yeasts. The most common organism responsible for this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a yeast-like fungus. An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis. Candidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it requires that the host immune system be severly depressed. Candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing factor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral course of antibiotics has been used. In diabetics, their secretions contain much higher amounts of glucose. Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in its food(fuel) selection. Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely survives. If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina. In diabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little buggers. The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus membrane or skin bloom site. Whether this is an allergic like reaction to the candida or not isnt certain. When the bloom is in the vagina or on the skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to ""treat"" it. If its internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty nondiscript. Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the vaginal tract which compete with it for food. The human immune system ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless they broach the mucus membrane ""barrier"". If they do, an inflammatory response will be set up. Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A from their diets. About 30% of all Americans die with less Vitamin A than they were born with(U.S. autopsy studies). While this low level of vitamin A does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane barrier system. This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong inflammatory response after a candida bloom. While diabetics can suffer from a candida ""bloom"" the most common cause of this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main competition for candida as far as food is concerned. While drugs are available to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection. The toxicity of the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution. But if the GI or sinus inflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum antibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring vaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says. But even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by the excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of the problem is addressed(lack of a ""good"" bacterial flora in the body and/or poor mucus membrane barrier). Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective therapy for candida overgrowth. From its name, it is an acid loving organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows. Candida can not grow very well in an acidic environment. In the vagina, L. acidophilius is the predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum antibiotics). In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract. One of the most effctive ways to minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear. If the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids. If the bloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology occurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool). This positive stool for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first place. After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong but her gut still hurt. On to another doctor, and so on. Richard Kaplan has told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of false positives(candida blooms guys?). If my gut hurt me on a constant basis, I would want it fixed. Yes its nice to know that I dont have colon cancer but what then is causing my distress? When I finally find a doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack. Candida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment. The vagina becomes alkaline during a womans period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina. Vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal problems. Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of Lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of the purity of the product before trying this). My wife had this vagina problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting scripts for anti-fungal creams. This was a woman gynocologist who had had the same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections). This M.D. did some digging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she used in your office to keep it sterile. After three treatments, sex returned to our marraige. I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his patients is a non-existent syndrome. The nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women. If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut. Through aresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes. But before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system needs to be strengthened. This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and some of the B-complex vitamins. Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans are not getting enough B6 and folate. These are probably the segement of the population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent disorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy). Some of the above material was obtained from ""Natural Healing"" by Mark Bricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human nutrition course. I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A sometime in the future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely important role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in the body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida blooms. Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate intake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI system is involved. If candida can not get glucose, its not going to out grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and fatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check once carbohydrate is returned to the gut. If Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post, fine. I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctors use of vitamin A and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut. People seeking advice from newsnet should not be treated this way. Those of us giving of our time and knowledge can slug it out to our hearts content. If you saved your venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly seeking help alone, I wouldnt have a problem with your behavior.

27,27.0,0.7444,"work, make, job, people, time, talk, today, year, question, president","From: (Clinton/Gore 92) Subject: CLINTON: Press Briefing by George Stephanopoulos 4.14.93 Organization: MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab Lines: 996 NNTP-Posting-Host: life.ai.mit.edu THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary _____________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release April 14, 1993 PRESS BRIEFING BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS The Briefing Room 12:40 P.M. EDT MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I guess Im just prepared to take questions today. Q George, Bob Dole says that the Clinton administrations policy on Bosnia is a failure and that he wants the United States to take the lead in lifting the arms embargo so that the Bosnian Muslims can defend themselves. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: As you know, President Clinton has said that that suggestion is under active consideration. Obviously, this is a tragic situation in Bosnia. And if the Bosnian Serbs dont come to the negotiating table in a constructive way, well look seriously at pressing for lifting the arms embargo. In the meantime, were going to continue to press for a tough sanctions resolution in the U.N. Were going to continue to work on the Serbs to come to the negotiating table. But the prospect of an arms embargo is something the President certainly will consider if the Serbs dont come to the table. Q How much longer are you going to give them to come to the table, George? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Were working on that right now. Q Its been a long time. Q On February 19th, the President mentioned the value added tax in Ohio. And when he was asked about it later by reporters, he said -- quote -- ""That is a radical change in the tax system of the United States. Its something I think we may have to look at in the years ahead."" Questioned again about it later he says, ""It is not something that is now under consideration. If we start considering it, Ill tell you."" It wasnt a trial balloon or anything, he said. I was just discussing the tax response to a question. Donna Shalala, quoted in USA Today this morning -- quote - - ""Certainly were looking at a VAT."" Whats gone on? Q The same with Alice Rivlin this morning. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The health care task force is reviewing a number of options. They havent made any decisions yet. And as I have said from this podium time and time again, were not going to comment on decisions that havent been made. Q But you have also said from this podium time and time again -- Q Wait a minute. Whoa, Nelly. Whoa. Q that that was not under consideration. Q Yes. Clinton says, ""It is not something that is now under consideration."" Is that no longer true? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I believe the working group, as Ms. Shalala says, has looked at this prospect, but no decisions have been made of any kind. Q Well, I know. But he said hed tell us about it if it was ever under consideration. I take it that now he is and he didnt tell us about it or -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Did he say if it was under consideration or if it was something to be proposed? Q ""If we start considering Ill tell you."" MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: If its something to be proposed? Q ""If we start considering it, Ill tell you."" Thats a direct quote. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The task force has looked at a number of different options. They have not made any decisions yet. The President has not made any decisions yet. This is -- one of the proposals under consideration by the task force was to go out and cast as wide a net as possible for different ideas on how to reform the health care system. They have cast a very wide net. They have looked at hundreds of different proposals -- probably thousands of different proposals. But the President has not made any decisions. Q Well, is the President aware of their consideration of this option? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I dont know if hes been briefed on any preliminary conclusions or anything like that from the task force on this specific proposal of any kind. I dont know that thats gotten to his level. He started yesterday to go through with the task force a very wide range of decisions and I dont believe that thats been presented to him, no. Q Well, hes not relying on the USA Today to tell him what his task force is considering in the way of taxes. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No, hes going through it in a very deliberate fashion. There are a number of decisions that have to be made. I dont know that this proposal has reached that decision- making point. Q If this is still under consideration, thats a change, at least from what weve been told by Dee Dee, I think about three weeks ago or so. She said, that is not an option, talking about the -- had a big argument with somebody over this, so I remember it specifically -- and said it not once, but twice. Is that not the case? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Again, I dont know if this has been presented to the President as something that is being looked at at some level in the task force. Q It was ruled it out, though. I mean, unlike other options that youve kept in the mix, this one specifically was ruled out. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Again, this is something that is being looked at, but no decision has been made of any kind. I mean, it doesnt -- its not necessarily material until you get to the decision-making phase. The working groups are looking at hundreds of different options. Q If it was ruled out before and its not ruled out now, then something has changed, George. Yes, no? Q When a guy says in February -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, the working groups are looking at the widest possible range of options. Q So somethings changed. They werent looking at it before; theyre looking at it now. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, I dont know if the working groups have gotten to that point yet. They are casting a very wide net. Q How was it possible that you and Dee Dee were able to sell -- definitively rule it out as an option previously and now are saying that, in fact, it is being considered? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Again, the working groups are looking at a wide range of options. They have not -- Q Do you deny that you and Dee Dee ruled it -- flatly ruled it out on several occasions in the past month? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I dont deny that -- I mean, those are the Presidents words. Those are very clear. Q Subsequent to the Presidents words, do you deny that within the last month you and Dee Dee have both publicly ruled it out? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I dont know about the timing. I think what we did was refer back to the Presidents words and say they stand. Q So dont they stand any longer? Q March 25th, Clinton said for the next four to five years it was ruled out. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, those words -- the President did say that in February. The working groups are on a separate track, and as I said, I dont believe -- Q Separate from the President? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I dont believe this has been presented to the President. Q Are they considering something that the President -- Q Has ruled out? Q has ruled out? I mean, will the President consider a VAT tax? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Again, the working groups have not presented this to the President. They have looked at a wide range of options. I suppose that if an argument is made, he will clearly listen to it. That does not mean he has decided to do it. Q Can we put this another way? In his answer in Ohio, he looked at the VAT in terms of restructuring the whole tax system. Under those -- that was the circumstance that he said it might be considered at some future point. Is that no longer the case, or is that the only way that he can see a VAT emerging? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I guess Im not sure exactly what youre asking. Q He talked about the VAT in the context of a restructured tax system, not as a specific way to finance health care, for example. Q Or anything else. Q Or anything else. Q It was always in the context of substituting for other taxes at a time of a dramatic overhaul of the whole tax system. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Right. Q Has that change, too? Q Is that still his view? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I havent spoken about those specific comments. I think -- I can just go back to it -- are the working groups -- have they examined the possibility of a VAT? Yes, they have. Q Certainly were looking at a VAT, she said. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: They have examined the possibility of a VAT. Has it been presented to the President? Has he made a decision? No, he has not. Q What kind of a deal do you have when youve got the Presidents appointed task force, obviously not oblivious to his ruling something out except in the context of some huge down the line reform, goes ahead on its own and considers a tax which he has specifically ruled out in any context other than much later, and then goes ahead and announces that thats what theyre looking at? Is the President concerned about that sort of thing? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think that the Presidents concern is to make sure he gets the best health care proposal possible. Hes concerned with making sure that they have the most thorough process for examining all the possible alternatives, all the different alternatives. If a decision is made to go forward with something like that its certainly something the President will explain and justify. But no decision has been made along those lines. Q What does it mean exactly, though, when the President rules something out? Does it mean it can get back on the table later if a more persuasive argument is made? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Thats just -- thats indisputably true. If you -- but, at the same time, he has not ruled it in. He has not made a proposal. Q What makes him open to it now when he wasnt open to it before? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Hes certainly willing to listen to the argument. Q Was he willing to listen to the argument for a short-term tax this year, and he wasnt willing to listen to it in Chilicothe? Hes now open to it -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The context of his comments was that it was not something -- he wanted to be clear that this is not something he was proposing, not something he was floating. Q Not something he was considering. Those are his words -- ""Its not something thats now under consideration. If we start considering it, Ill tell you."" Youre now acknowledging, are you not, that it is under consideration and -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Im acknowledging that the task force has studied this proposal. I am also stating that the President has not made a decision on it. Q But the door is open for the President to reconsider including this as part of -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Obviously, the working groups are looking at it. Again, but the President has not made a decision. Q Do you know if they will make a presentation on behalf of the VAT to him? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I dont know that. I assume that if -- I dont know what stage they are it in proposing. I dont know that theyre going to make the conclusion that this is something they should present to him. I know this is something the working groups are looking at. Q Do you understand, George, that none of us are asking these questions in context of a decision that the President has made, only about what the President is considering? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I understand that, and I am acknowledging that the working groups have examined the issue of a VAT. Q And the President will consider it? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I assume that he will consider the argument if it is presented to him. Q Does that mean the President -- that working groups think that when the President says no, he means maybe? (Laughter.) MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think that means that the working groups are trying to do the most thorough job possible. Q George, can I ask you another question about Bosnia? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Sure. (Laughter.) Q No, he wants us to stay on this. Q Lets do gays in the military. (Laughter.) Q No, he got out of that swamp. Q I think weve gotten the bottom line on that VAT. Reggie Bartholomew, your Special Ambassador in Belgrade, today said that if the Serbs do not accept the agreement that has been worked out -- quote -- ""We will do our part to pursue the lifting of the arms embargo together with our allies."" That seems to go a bit further than what youve just said -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Sounds almost exactly what I just said. Q Well, do you accept -- in other words, you accept what Reggie -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, the President has said that this is something thats under consideration. It is something he will consider if the current actions dont bring the Serbs to the table. Q Isnt there some kind of timetable here? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes, there is a timetable. Theres going to be a vote on the U.N. resolution in about 10 days. Q Thats on sanctions, thats on tightening the sanctions. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Thats right, thats sanctions. And we believe that that will ratchet up the pressure, and we hope that that will bring the Serbs to the table. As you know, Mr. Bartholomew also met with Mr. Churkin of Russia, and they are also working on ways to bring the Serbs to the table. We will continue to pressure them in many different ways and this is one possible option as well. Q The question is whether theres a timetable for consideration or a vote on a decision on lifting the arms embargo, not the sanctions. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The next vote in the U.N. is on sanctions. As far as I know, there are no votes scheduled on lifting the arms embargo. But it is something that we have discussed both internally and with our allies. Q Why did Reggie Bartholomew tell the Serbs that the U.S. would do that? What was the point of his telling them that? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, clearly, I mean, this is something thats under consideration, and this is something that we take quite seriously if they do not come to the table. They should know the consequences of failing to come to the table. Q Have they been given a deadline? Q Warren Christopher has been saying the same thing and it hasnt seemed to change the Serbs behavior in the least. Why should the Serbs take any heed of a threat to lift the arms embargo when so far everything thats been done has had no effect on the fighting in Bosnia? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I just dont accept the premise of your question. It has had an effect; the embargo is having an effect. Q What effect? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: If the Serbians choose not to heed our warnings, then they will face the consequences. Q What effect has it had in Bosnia? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, the effect that it has had on the Serbians, it has tightened up -- they are not getting their shipments through. We can brief more fully -- Q In Bosnia, George. In Bosnia what effect has it had? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, its hard to say if its stopped the aggression to date. That is why were continuing to press for the Serbians to stop. But we believe that over time we will continue to weaken the Serbs and that will have an effect. Im not saying its going to happen overnight; it clearly hasnt happened overnight. But we believe that over time the sanctions can weaken the Serbs. If it fails to work and if the Serbs fail to come to the negotiating table, well move forward with the embargo. Q Isnt there a working deadline, George, of the 24th -- the same date as the U.N. -- the scheduled U.N. vote? Hasnt the United States said, along with many of the other NATO allies, that if the Serbs arent willing to sign on to the peace accord by then, that well seek -- havent we said that we will seek -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Weve said continually were going to -- Q But on that deadline? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I dont have a specific date, but were going to move forward with the resolution, the U.N. resolution, by around that time. And if that fails to take effect, if that fails to bring the Serbs to the table, we will clearly consider other actions. Q Isnt this awfully incremental? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Were taking a step-by-step approach. Were ratcheting up the pressure and were going to continue to do that. Q Is there a possibility, George, that by the time all these incremental steps are taken the Serbs will have achieved their goals and then whats the purpose? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think the purpose is to get the Serbs to stop the aggression. We are pursuing that goal on many different fronts. We are pursuing it through the U.N.; were pursuing it through direct talks; we are pursuing it through tightening the sanctions. And we will consider lifting the arms embargo. We are turning the screws up on the Serbs and we will continue to do that. Q But if the efforts have been unsuccessful in getting the Serbs to stop the aggression how effective will any campaign be to have the Serbs give back what theyve gained? I mean, once theyre entrenched -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I cant speculate on that. Were going to continue to press for them to come to the table now. Were going to continue to find ways to stop the aggression. But I cant see into the future. Q George, on the stimulus package, House Republicans say theyre going to hold a series of town meetings on Saturday to try and explain the details of your package. They cite polls which show that the more people learn about it, the less they like it. Whats your strategy to counter that? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The strategy we have is the one were going to continue. As you saw, the President today pointed up the very real benefits of the summer jobs program that this package will provide: 700,000 new summer jobs this summer for kids in inner cities and suburbs to do productive work. We are also going to point out the benefits of the highway money, the investments in highways. Were going to point up the benefits of immunization. Were going to point up the benefits of Head Start. We are going to say that the Republicans have a choice: they can take action to create jobs or they can perpetuate the gridlock of the last four years. Q Does it concern you, though, that the House now, the House Republicans are after you as well as the Senate? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The House Republicans voted against it before. They made a mistake then; theyre making a mistake now. Q George, does it strike anybody in the administration that its a bit strong to describe, as the President did this morning, the summer jobs program as -- quote -- ""a reaffirmation of a promise of America""? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Not at all. I think its the promise of America to give kids a chance to reach their full potential. Q Government-funded jobs? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: To give people a chance to work? Absolutely. That is the promise of America. Q I want to follow up on something I asked yesterday -- where does 700,000 summer jobs, where does that figure come from? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: That is on top of. I did look at it. There are currently 600,000 summer jobs in the pipeline. This will be on top of the 600,000, so it will be a total of 1.3 million. Q The 700,000 would be created by the stimulus package? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes. Q Where does that number come from? Because weve been told all along that the stimulus package would create 500,000 new jobs. And according to Panetta, that breaks down to something like 200,000 full-time jobs and 150,000 summer jobs. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes, but the summer -- thats when you do their full-time equivalence. I mean, 700,000 individuals will receive jobs this summer. When you calculate it for the full-time job effect, you have to do -- I dont know what the exact formula is. Q Seven hundred thousand part-time jobs -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: -- 150,000 or -- Q One to four because its three months. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Thank you. Q Can I follow up on that? Did the President misspeak this morning when he said that some of the government money for these summer jobs will pay for private -- for kids to work in the private sector? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Not necessarily. I mean, I think that there will be grants available. Thats one of the ways that you pay for the jobs. At the same time, hes also issued a challenge to the private sector to hire kids on their own as well. Q Tax dollars, for instance, would pay for kids to work at Time-Warner? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think the Time-Warner is actually somebody coming forward and actually doing a grant. Thats going to be the bulk of it. There could be isolated instances, though, where there would be grants to businesses. Q Has the President spoken with any Senate Republicans this week? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No, but theres been a lot of contact with Senate Republicans in the White House. Q At a lower level. But the President hasnt? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The President has not, no. Q Getting any closer to get the votes? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Were continuing to work on it. Q Anybody leaning your way? Q On Haiti, The New York Times seems to be reporting something of a breakthrough in Aristides attitude towards the coup leaders. Can you confirm that there has been this change, and what impact will it have on the process? And what did Pezzullo have to say yesterday in his report? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Pezzullo did brief the principals. I cant confirm whats actually happening in the talks. I would leave that to the negotiators themselves. But Mr. Caputo has returned to Haiti. We have received a briefing here at the White House from Ambassador Pezzullo. And as we have said time and time again, we believe that assurances of security are important to a final resolution to a broader political settlement. Q George, yesterday you offered some selective breakdowns of how the stimulus would impact some states and cities. Can we get a complete breakdown by state of how these jobs would be impacted? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think we have it for most states, yes. And I think we can get it out. Q Could you make that generally available? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I believe we can. Q And could you do it by the component of the stimulus? In other words -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I dont know if we can do -- I know that we can do it by summer jobs and other jobs. I dont know how deeply it can be broken down. But clearly, we can break it down into summer jobs and other jobs. Q And can I follow up? Is this the information that Jeff Eller and the rest of the White House is using in the ads in the states? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I dont know if theyre ads, but theyre press releases. Q Can you describe what those press releases contain? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: All were doing is pointing out the benefits of this package to various states. For instance, I know that today Senator Dole is heading up to Vermont and New Hampshire. And I would point out that the stimulus package, the jobs package creates 1,000 jobs in Vermont. It creates 2,000 jobs in New Hampshire. And the people of those states should remind him that this is important. Q Where are the releases going? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: They go to the states. Q To whom? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: We can get them. Its no problem. Q Can we get it? Q Why dont you put them out here as well? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think we can. Q This afternoon? Would that be possible? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Ill have to check. I dont know. But as soon as we can. Q Are you focusing these press releases on states where there are moderate or pragmatic Republican senators? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think were trying to get as many as we can. Its actually quite difficult to pull this together and were doing our best. Were putting them out as we get them. Q Why are you so closely tracking Senator Doles schedule? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I was just following it. Q Are press releases going along to states where hes visiting? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Im not sure. I think that probably there are press releases going to Vermont. (Laughter.) Q Will there be a man in a chicken suit waiting? (Laughter.) Q George, as the President goes about the business of defending whats in his stimulus package, he doesnt address what seems to be the Republicans main point, that youre funding it with deficit spending rather than ""if its so important, why not come up with the funding for it"" seems to be the Republican argument. And how do you answer that? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: What was answer is, we are paying for it over time. And if you look at our budget, we pay for this package over time. We believe right now the economy needs a jump- start for jobs. Q Youre not claiming, are you, that that doesnt add to the deficit this year? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Im saying were paying for it over time. I didnt say that. Q I know that, George. But I mean, from the beginning, the question -- we do have annual budgets and things -- deficit spending will pay for that this year, will it not? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: This year they clearly will. But over time our budget fully pays for this program. Q What youre saying is that there are savings that would cover this if it were this year in future years? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Absolutely. Thats exactly what I said. Q I know that, but there is going to be outstanding debt, it will add to the national debt from this year -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No, were reducing the deficit by $500 billion -- $514 billion over the next four years. Q You mean youre reducing it below what it would have been? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Exactly. Q In fact, youre adding a very large amount to the national debt over the period of -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: But were reducing it far more from what it would have been. Thats true. Q Washington-type reduction. (Laughter.) Q Youre getting to be a grumpy old man. Q George, has any decision been made about the White House or the Presidents participation in the gay rights march coming up in a week and a half? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Were working on the Presidents schedule now. I believe hes going to be at the Senate Democratic retreat in Jamestown that weekend. Q Will he address it by phone? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I dont know about that. Its a little far out, but I believe hes going to be in the Senate retreat. Q So will he have the leaders in a day or two before the speech? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I dont know. I would expect that at some point he would meet with the leaders of some of these groups. I dont know the schedule on it, though. Q Will there be an AIDS czar appointed prior to or in conjunction with the event? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Im just not sure. Q April 22nd is Earth Day. What is the President going to do to mark that, and is it the case that he is going to sign the biodiversity treaty that day? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I know theres been some work on the biodiversity treaty. I dont know about signing it that day, but I would expect hell have a statement on Earth Day or right around then. Q Where is the work on the biodiversity treaty? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Id have to check with Katie McGinty. I just know that theres been some work done, but I dont know exactly what. Q When is Earth Day? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The 22nd, I think. Q Why is it you know that he is going to have a statement on Earth Day but you dont know if hes going to have a statement on the gay rights march? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I said I dont know if hes going to meet or when hes going to meet. Q Do you have a statement on the gay rights march? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I dont, actually, no. I wouldnt be surprised if he did, though. Q Do you have some details on the Miyazawa visit? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Its a working visit on Friday and the President is looking forward to that in discussing a number of issues including Russian aid and the Japanese stimulus package and the trade issues between the two countries. Q There was some expectations that a second aid package to Russia was going to be unveiled at the G-7 meeting and, if I understand, it hasnt happened. Why is that or whats the status on that? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The G-7 meeting is still going on and, as you know, Secretaries Bentsen and Christopher have talked about the outlines of a possible package. But were going to continue to consult with Congress and our G-7 allies on that. Q? We will not then make any kind of announcement during the two-day meeting? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The meetings not over yet. Q Is that when youre going to make one? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Im not ruling out the possibility. Q the Presidents going to announce it tomorrow. Q Bentsen said that. Q Yes, Bentsen said it would be tomorrow. Q So did Christopher. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Id have to look at that, but I believe it is more likely that the announcement will come out of Tokyo. Q George, has there been further consideration here about going to -- sending the President out to Los Angeles? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I dont know that theres -- its not something weve ruled out. We dont have a date set for it. Q George, you all have a position or do you support Immigrations plan to settle 4,000 Iraqi prisoners in the United States? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Its the first Ive heard of it. Q George, there was a report today about the -- Q Fortunately. (Laughter.) Q about the pace of appointments and says that President Clinton is behind President Bush in the number of positions that people have been nominated for. Are you going to speed up the pace of nominations or where do you stand with it? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: We filled 814 of the Presidents appointments. And its broken down -- we have 384 Schedule C; 147 noncareer SES; 213 PAS full-time. Im not sure what that means -- (laughter) -- 70 PA full-time. And this is about the same -- its about the same pace of President Bush. Obviously, as you move along farther, once you -- each level of appointment actually has a multiplier effect and frees up far more appointments. So we expect the process to speed up. But were at the pace of Bush. Obviously wed like to get these done as quickly as possible. I would point out that the FBI background checks and the background check is far more comprehensive and it takes more time than our predecessors, and that is part of the holdup. But were working on it. Q Is that because of Nannygate? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think thats an awful big part of it, yes. Q In the story this morning, you were at approximately the same pace as Bush in making appointments, but way behind in winning confirmations. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Thats where the background checks comes into play. Thats the problem. Q Thats the background checks problem? Because I mean, you have a Democratic Senate -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: No, thats not the -- you make the appointments, and then it takes quite a bit of time to fill out all the forms and have the background checks done. Thats exactly where the problem is. Q Whats the President doing this afternoon, and whats on the plan for tomorrow? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Hes got some meetings -- just office meetings this afternoon for the most part, on a variety of issues that -- probably a half-dozen different issues. And then hell be -- tomorrow well have an event, probably again focused on the stimulus and jobs package out of here at the White House. And Friday is the Miyazawa meeting. Q Will you be releasing his tax return tomorrow, George? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Either tomorrow or Friday. Q Is there going to be a pre-briefing regarding the Japanese Prime Ministers visit tomorrow? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I dont know about tomorrow, but well probably get something done, as we usually do, for these visits. Q Was Reverend Jackson here this morning and do you know what that was about? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: He was here. He met with a group of us here at the White House, including Mack McLarty. Q Who? Q Reverend Jackson. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Reverend Jackson. Mack McLarty, me, Gene Sperling, Bruce Reed, Jeff Watson, Mark Gearan. Q Talking about Haiti? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: We talked about general urban policy. He is about to go to Los Angeles. He was just back from Mississippi, where we had a good victory last night; and hes going on to Los Angeles. Q Did he request the meeting? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Actually, no. Hes in continual contact with the President. He had written a letter on a variety of issues, and so we asked him to come in and talk about it. Q George, Dole is having a fundraiser for Jeffords tonight in Vermont. Have you guys been in contact with Jeffords at all on this? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I think theres been some contact, sure. Q Can you tell us about the contacts? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Im not sure -- Q Do you know who contacted him or what was said? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I know that Howard Paster talked to him and they just has a general talk about the package. Q And did he express his support for it now, or is he -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I cant divulge the details of the conversation, but there have been conversations. Q The L.A. Times is reporting that abortion -- elective abortions is likely to be included in the basic health care package. Is this something the President is considering? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Again -- Q Along with the VAT? (Laughter.) MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Its certainly something thats been looked at, but no decisions have been made. Q What was the question? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: The L.A. Times story on whether abortions will be covered by the Presidents health plan. Q Did the President in his meeting -- did you in your meeting with Reverend Jackson ask his advice, solicit his advice about what kind of stance the White House should take in the wake of the verdict in L.A.? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, we certainly talked about the situation in Los Angeles and the long-term prospects for economic development and other issues. Q For instance, did you discuss whether it would be helpful for the President to go there or not? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, we discussed a wide range of issues related to Los Angeles. That was certainly one of them. Q Letting you perhaps go out on the way you came in, I need to go back to Bosnia just for a second and ask -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Oh, good. Q your reaction to Margaret Thatchers comments that youre just sitting by and watching a massacre. MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, weve been pushing very hard on a number of fronts for more aggressive action. We will continue to do that. Q Can you tell us if youve made any progress in your talks on the stimulus package getting a compromise? I mean, we dont have any feel except talks are ongoing. Have you talked to like 20 people or -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I dont know the numbers. Weve talked to several people and weve had wide-ranging sessions. Q Anyone leaning your way? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS: I cant get into that. Were just going to keep working through Tuesday. THE PRESS: Thank you. END 1:10 P.M. EDT #56-04/14 "

This is a strawman argument and fails on several grounds. In this case, ""limited"" and ""big"" government are not defined. I would point out that Lebanon, Somalia, and the former Yugoslavia are by some definitions nations with ""limited"" government, while the US, Canada, and nations in Western Europe (where ""people would rather live"") are often pointed out as nations with ""big government"" from a libertarian point of view. The argument is not between those who want ""limited"" government and those who want ""unlimited"" government. It is between those who believe government regulation in a capitalist economy serves worthwhile ends and those who believe such regulation is neither desirable on empirical grounds nor justifiable on ideological grounds. jsh >-- >Paul Schmidt: Advocates for Self-Government, Davy Crockett Chapter President -- Steve Hendricks | DOMAIN: ""One thing about data, it sure does cut| UUCP: ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh the bulls**t."" - R.
