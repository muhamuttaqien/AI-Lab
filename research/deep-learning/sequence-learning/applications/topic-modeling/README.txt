1. Document-level Topic Modeling
2. Sentence-level Topic Modeling
3. Sub-sentence-level Topic Modeling

TECHNIQUES OF TEXT SUMMARIZATION (Using Gensim or Scikit-learn):

1. Topic Modeling Using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) Algorithm (Linear Model)
2. Topic Modeling Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) Algorithm (as the most popular method in real-world applications)
3. Variant Advanced-LDA (LDA Mallet & LDA2Vec)

APPLICATION OF TEXT SUMMARIZATION:

1. Real-Time Product Monitoring (Combined with Sentiment Analysis)
2. Customer Service Automation
3. Topic-based News & Articles (Documents Clustering)
