but the breakdown voltage for dielectric films is usually nonlinear.
this can double the peak current rating.
this film can therefore be made of a different and less expensive material.
the highest surge-current rated film capacitors are film/foil capacitors with a metal foil construction.
"however, metal foil capacitors do not have self-healing properties."
"an early special type of plastic film capacitors were the cellulose acetate film capacitors, also called mku capacitors."
characteristics of mixed film materials are not listed here.

the required capacitance tolerance is determined by the particular application.
the derating factors apply to both dc and ac voltages.
"the allowable peak value of a superimposed alternating voltage, called the rated ripple voltage, is frequency-dependent."
film capacitors are not polarized and are suitable for handling an alternating voltage.
some capacitors are designed to minimise this effect.

"the dissipation factor of film capacitors is frequency-, temperature- and time-dependent."
film capacitors are subject to certain very small but measurable aging processes.
two main advantages of film capacitors are very low esr and esl values.
snubber capacitors  require a very low self-inductance and very low esr capacitor construction.  
"the most important criteria for this application are a low self-inductance, low esr, and very high peak current capability."
the so-called snubber capacitors sometimes have some additional special construction features.
both ac and dc capacitors are available.
surge  discharge capacitors are also capable of supplying or absorbing extreme short-duration current surges.
power capacitors can reach quite large physical dimensions.
