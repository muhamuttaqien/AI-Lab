In math form, old A3C objective could be written as
\begin{math}J_\theta=\E_t[\nabla_\theta\log\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)A_t]\end{math}.
The new objective proposed by the PPO
is \begin{math}J_\theta=\E_t[\frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{old}}(a_t|s_t)}A_t]\end{math}.
But if we just start to blindly maximize this value, it will lead to very large
update to the policy weights. To limit the update, the clipped objective is
used.
If we write the ratio between the new and the old policy as
\begin{math}r_t(\theta)=\frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{old}}(a_t|s_t)}\end{math},
the clipped objective could be written as this
\begin{equation*}
  J_\theta^{clip}=\E_t[\min(r_t(\theta)A_t, clip(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon,
    1+\epsilon)A_t)]
\end{equation*}
This objective limits the ratio
between the old and the new policy to be in the interval \begin{math}[1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon]\end{math}, so, by
varying \begin{math}\epsilon\end{math} we can limit the size of the update.

Another difference from the A3C method, is the way we estimate the advantage.
In the A3C paper, the advantage obtained from the finite-horizon estimation of T
steps in the form:

\begin{equation*}
  A_t=-V(s_t)+r_t+\gamma r_{t+1} + \ldots + \gamma^{T-t+1}r_{T-1}+\gamma^{T-t}V(s_T)
\end{equation*}

In the PPO paper, the authors used more general estimation in the form of

\begin{equation*}
  A_t= \sigma_t+(\gamma\lambda)\sigma_{t+1}+(\gamma\lambda)^2\sigma_{t+2}+\ldots+(\gamma\lambda)^{T-t+1}\sigma_{T-1}
\end{equation*}
where \begin{math}\sigma_t=r_t+\gamma V(s_{t+1})-V(s_t)\end{math}. The original
A3C estimation, is a special case of the proposed method with \begin{math}\lambda=1\end{math}.

the advantage estimation (tracked in last\_gae variable) is calculated as the sum of deltas with discount
factor \begin{math}\gamma\lambda\end{math}.

In the next step, we calculate the logarithm of probability of the actions taken. This value will be used as
\begin{math}\pi_{\theta_{old}}\end{math} in the surrogate objective of PPO. Additionally, we normalize the advantageâ€™s
mean and variance to improve the training stability.

In the actor training, we minimize the negated clipped objective,
\begin{equation*}
\E_t[\min(r_t(\theta)A_t,clip(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon)A_t)]
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{math}r_t(\theta)=\frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{old}}(a_t|s_t)}\end{math}.
The lines below is straightforward implementation of this formula.

As the first step, TRPO method defines the discounted visitation frequencies of
the state: \begin{math}\rho_\pi(s)=P(s_0=s)+\gamma P(s_1=s)+\gamma^2 P(s_2=s)+\ldots\end{math}.
In this equation, \begin{math}P(s_i=s)\end{math} equals to the sampled
probability of state s to be met at position i of the sampled trajectories.
Then, TRPO defines the optimisation objective as
\begin{math}L_\pi(\tilde{\pi})=\eta(\pi) +
  \sum_s\rho_\pi(s)\sum_a\tilde{\pi}(a|s)A_\pi(s, a)\end{math},
where \begin{math}\eta(\pi)=\E[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\gamma^t r(s_t)]\end{math} is
the expected discounted reward of the policy and
\begin{math}\tilde{\pi}=\argmax_aA_\pi(s, a)\end{math} defines the deterministic policy.
To address the issue with large policy updates, TRPO defines the additional
constraint on the policy update, expressed as a maximum Kullback-Leibler
divergence between the old and the new policies, which could be written as
\begin{math}\bar{D}_{KL}^{\rho_{\theta_{old}}}(\theta_{old},\theta) \leq \delta\end{math}
.
