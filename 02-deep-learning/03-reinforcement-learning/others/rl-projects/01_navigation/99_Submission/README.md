# Deep Reinforcement Learning : Navigation

This project repository is my work on 1st Project: Navigation for Udacity's [Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893).

## Project's Description
In this Navigation project, I have to train an agent to navigate on a large square world and collect yellow bananas. The goal is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while at the same time avoiding blue bananas. The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, the agent must get an average score of at least +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

## The Environment

The environment is provided by [Unity ML-agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents). The project environment used for this project is similar to one of the example environments, but not identical to the [Banana Collector](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#banana-collector) environment on the Unity ML-agents Github page.

After checking how the environment provided by Unity behaves, here are the details about the rewards, state & action spaces:

#### Rewards

1. The agent is given a reward of +1 for successfully collecting a yellow banana]
2. Reward of -1 for collecting a blue banana

#### State Space

The environment contains 37 dimensions and the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around the agent's forward direction.

#### Action Space

There are four possible discreate actions that agent can perform including 0 for move forward, 1 for move backward, 2 for turn left and 3 for turn right.

## Project Installation

#### Step 1: Clone the DRLND Repository
1. Configure your Python environment by following instructions described in the [DRLND Github repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies). The instructions can be found in the [Readme.md](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Readme.md) file.
2. By following the instructions, then you will have your own PyTorch, the ML-agents toolkit, and all the Python packages required to complete the project.
3. (For Windows users) The ML-agents toolkit supports Windows 10.

#### Step 2: Download the Unity Environment
For running this project you need to install the Unity environment as completely described in the [Getting Started section](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/blob/master/p1_navigation/README.md).

#### Step 3: Explore the Environment
After you have followed two installment steps above, then you can explore the project environment by opening `Navigation.ipynb` located on the root repository. You can follow the instructions to learn how to use the Python API to control the agent.

## Train The Agent
You can try to train the agent yourself by executing the provided jupyter notebook within this project repository. By working in your local environment, the workspace will allow you to see the simulator of the environment and watch directly how our trained agent smartly behaves with the environment.
