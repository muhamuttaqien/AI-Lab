TYPES OF TEXT SUMMARIZATION:

1. Extraction-based Summarization
2. Abstraction-based Summarization (Mostly, Deep-Learning)

TECHNIQUES OF TEXT SUMMARIZATION:

1. Rule-based Sentence Scoring based on Word Frequency
2. Machine Learning Using Word Embeddings, Similarity Matrix and TextRank Algorithm
3. Machine Learning Using K-Means Clustering with Cosine Similarity Centroid as Representative Sentences
4. Deep Learning Using Sequence-to-Sequence with Attention Network (Summary datasets from News)

APPLICATION OF TEXT SUMMARIZATION:

1. Extracting Useful Information (Leaving out The Inessential and Insignificant)
2. Big Data Readability Enhanchment (Reading Time Reduction)
