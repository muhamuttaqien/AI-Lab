1. DATASETS SIZE
The generalization capability of a deep learning model enhances with an increase in the training dataset size.

2. BI-DIRECTIONAL MODEL
Implementing Bi-Directional GRU/ LSTM is capable of capturing the context from both the directions and results in a better context vector.

3. SEARCH STRATEGY OF INFERENCING
Use the beam search strategy for decoding the test sequence instead of using the greedy approach (argmax).

4. BLEU SCORE EVALUATION
Evaluate the performance of model based on the BLEU score.
