Just briefly, on something that you mentioned in passing. You refer to differing interpretations of ""create,"" and say that many Christians may not agree. So what? That is really irrelevant. We do not base our faith on how many people think one way or another, do we? The bottom line is truth, regardless of popularity of opinions. Also, I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created and eternally existent are equivalent, you say ""granted the Mormon belief..."" You cant grant your conclusion and then expect the point to have been addressed. In order to reply to the issue, you have to address and answer the point that was raised, and not just jump to the conclusion that you grant. The Bible states that Lucifer was created. The Bible states that Jesus is the creator of all. The contradiction that we have is that the LDS belief is that Jesus and Lucifer were the same. ra> > Your point that we all are brothers of Jesus and Lucifer is also ra> > heretical, since we are not innately brothers and sisters of Christ. ra> > We are adopted, ""For ye have not received the spirit of bondage ra> > again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby ra> > we cry, Abba, Father.""

(John 1:12-13) ra> ra> Has it occured to you, Robert, that being ""born of"" someone or being ra> of that person (or Person)s ""family"" may be a symbolic term in the New ra> Testament? Mormons believe that we are ""adopted"" into the House of ra> Israel through baptism and faith in Christ, although some have expressed ra> belief that this does evince a physical change in our bodies. The Mormon belief is that all are children of God. Literally. There is nothing symbolic about it. This however, contradicts what the Bible says. The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God: The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked [one]; (Matthew 13:38) I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father. (John 8:38) Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God. Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. Why do ye not understand my speech? [even] because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. (John 8:41-44) And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, [thou] child of the devil, [thou] enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord? (Acts 13:10) Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience: (Ephesians 2:2) In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother. (1 John 3:10) One becomes a child of God... But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, [even] to them that believe on his name: (John 1:12) Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. (1 John 3:1-2) ...when he is born again through faith in Jesus Christ: Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. (John 1:13) Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, (Ephesians 1:5) Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. (James 1:18) For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: (Romans 8:14-16) Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. (1 John 4:7) Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him. (1 John 5:1) For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. (Galatians 3:26) ra> > We are told that, ""And this is life eternal, that they might know ra> > thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent."" ra> > (John 17:3). Life eternal is to know the only true God.

Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of Bruce McConkie and whether his views were official doctrine. I dont think that it matters if McConkies views were canon.

Some Jewish collaborators were killed. Israel also wishes to rule over Gaza through Arab collaborators. As Israel denies Gazans the only two options which are compatible with basic human rights and international law, that of becoming Israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for self-determination, it must be concluded that the Israeli Jewish society does not consider Gazans full human beings.

As I recall the water isnt as hot (thermodynamically) in many >>fossil fuel plants, and of course there is less danger of radioactive >>contamination. Actually the reasons you dont see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are 1) fossil units (multiple units per plant) are generally smaller than nuclear plants. 300 MWe seemed to be a very popular size when many fossil plants were built. The average nuclear plant is 1000 MWe. 2) many fossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were adopted (""why those old dirt burners cant harm anything, let em go.""). 3) powered draft cooling towers, low enough to the ground to be generally not visible from off-site, are quite popular with fossil plants. 4) fossil plants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears. > Actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual >boiling-water reactor nuclear plants.

Some plants do cool the condensers with water, >rather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about ""thermal >pollution"" de-icing a river, said, ""Up here, we view heat as a resource"". Actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants of similar size. The issues are the same regardless of where the heat comes from. Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in order to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine. The condenser pressure is normally waters vapor pressure at the condensing temperature. It is desirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity causes erosion of the condenser tubes. The coldest and thus lowest pressure condensing environment is always the best. A related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (where the water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.) Since the condenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity. If the condensate is too hot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash into steam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate. This is a particularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all costs. The hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant in order to provide a gravity head to the pumps. How much lower they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in the hotwell. Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120 degrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term is used to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower system is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water is pumped.) When the river water temperature is high in the summer, operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order to provide more gravity head. There is a tradeoff involved since higher hotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the condenser area. At least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the air :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge water from the cooling towers. The temperature of the discharge water from the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and humidity. It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river water temperatures exceeding 70 degrees. A vast difference from the typical ""95-95"" days (95 degrees, 95% humidity) we see routinely in the East. It is not unusual, particularly where the econazis have been successful in clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant, for the plant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets too high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive pressure. > Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers. The water used is >purified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when >the water boils. Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than >cooling it, so the boiler water is recycled. True. Actually secondary plant (the part that makes electricity and feeds feedwater to the boiler) water chemistry has been the bastard stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves. The plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood the costs of impure water. By ""impure"", I mean water with a few dozen extra micromho of conductivity and/or a few PPM of dissolved oxygen. Secondary water is now typically the most pure one will find outside the laboratory.

[1] Born 1964 Secretary-Typist Azsantekmontazh Trust Sumgait Construction and Installation Administration Secretary of the SMU Komsomol Organization Resident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15 Microdistrict No. 3 Sumgait [Azerbaijan] On the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven oclock show, at the theater that is across from the City Party Committee, about 50 yards away. The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, ""The Abyss."" Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at the City Party Committee, but they were silent, theres no conversation whatsoever, and we couldnt figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it was about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if someone gave a speech or not, we didnt know. We bought our tickets. There were 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that large movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the film. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well mostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an Armenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do to Armenian girls. I thought thats what they meant because they had demanded a girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move over, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone recognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina. It got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--its only opened at the end of the show--and they returned to their seats. Everyone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis, people of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the auditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and gradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, ""OK, weve scared them enough, lets leave."" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to me that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of ""anasha"", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like they were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing had happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful films which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We could barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine, and it was dark . . . Marina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, thats the center of town. Lenin Street was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting, something about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We werent especially listening, because the way we were feeling we didnt know if we were going to make it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation wasnt running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police, policemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the doors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors there are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief- stricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well, since he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super serious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we live literally one stop away. We didnt want to go on foot, not because it was dark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the driver didnt want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and he said hed take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well, OK . . . So we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was happening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation was at a standstill and everyone was shouting ""Ka-ra-bagh,"" theyre not going to give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family whats going on, and theres immediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had come, they were going to come, kill us, thats it . . . Somehow we managed to cheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway, just what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma down. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though nothing had happened. That was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didnt go anywhere and didnt call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on. That day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldnt guess. On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always had. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda, Marina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and no one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that morning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at home and didnt know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda Zimogliad, came by at around three oclock I think. We worked together, we did our apprenticeships together, shes a Russian girl. She said that something awful was happening in town. I asked, ""Dont they want Armenians? Well what are they after, if theyre already in that state?"" She says, no, nothing like that, its just a demonstration, but its awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels like a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The cabs, the buses, well its just a nightmare. Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy problems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera, asked him, ""Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going on in the courtyard; arent you afraid to go out?"" Papa didnt know what she was talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home and told Mamma. Mamma said, ""Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means that something is really going on."" But we didnt go see her, shes a Russian, she lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five oclock I tell Lyuda, ""Ok, look, its time for you to go, its late already, Ill see you out."" Mamma says, ""You dont need to go, its too late already, you can see what the situation in town is."" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was ready. Mamma says, ""Let her eat with us, then she can go."" We sat down at the table. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything out on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that were eating. We turned on the television, and the show ""In Fairy-Tale Land"" was coming on. We cleared the table. We hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I cant see whats going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus station, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people . . . I cant figure out whats happening. Theyre shouting something, looking somewhere, I cant make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, shes an Azerbaijani; weve been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down to look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story buildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20 people, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see several people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide that means its not all that bad if they are laughing: it means theyre not killing anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of the soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their feet, everyones kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . . cant speak . . . Well, theyve probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . . If each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him and started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldnt see if he got up and left or not. I become terrified and go home and say, ""Lyuda, dont go anywhere, stay at our place, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . "" Then the crowd runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and starts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors are also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it turns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and kept them from coming in. Theres only one entryway there, they could stop them. They all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows, afraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the windows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard, and its packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they dont crush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. Its just a huge cloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey Sargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear tramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous din and roar. Its incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were shouting Fathers name, ""Grisha, open the door, weve come to kill you!,"" or something like that. I dont remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma says, ""Into the bedroom, quickly!"" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part of our dowry; Mamma says, ""Hide there, they probably wont come in there, theyll ask something, say something, and leave."" She says, ""Well tell them that we live alone here."" I cant imagine that my parents will stand out in the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say that Ill stand together with them, Ill talk with them if they come, maybe I can find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak Azerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and Lyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I cant remember if I told her anything or not. Then . . . they open the door: its like they blew on it and it broke and fell right into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here, leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I tell them, ""What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what has happened."" In Azerbaijani, they say, ""Get out of the apartment, leave."" I say, ""OK. Go downstairs. Well gather everything we need and leave the apartment."" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with them, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the doorway, the young guys, say, ""There are old people and one girl with them. Too bad!"" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have pacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts, commanding them: ""Dont you understand what you are saying? Kill them?"" And that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one room, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start undressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there, in front of Mamma. I dont remember where they went, what they did, or how much time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body, and tore my clothes, all at the same time, I dont even know what I said. The atrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among themselves who would go first. Later, I remember, I came to. I dont know if Im dead or alive. Someone comes in, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding. He looks around at whats happening. At that instant everything stops. It seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything depends on him. He looks and says, ""Well, were done here."" They are beating Mamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs . . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that shes dead. Papa . . . was out cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they cant get the window open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the windows cant be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking about being thrown out the window and passed out. Shes not a real strong person anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that Im saying something, that Im still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be, which is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they dont get any entreaty out of me. I already know that Im dead, why would I humble myself before anyone? And he says that if thats what I think, since my tongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing . . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside. I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I dont know if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by my arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings, something metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone else is pinching me . . .I dont even know. I think, my God, when will death come? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near the entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What happened after that, how many people there were, I dont remember. I come to after a while, I dont remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me clothing. Im entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember that I said the same words over and over again: ""Mamma, what happened, Mamma, what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?"" I cant make sense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he served in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all went to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his courage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors, even though hes small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he served in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served there, I think; now hes stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor brought me to the neighbors, and then helped me come to my senses, saying, ""Karina, I know you, calm down, Im not one of them."" How do I know whos who and whats what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then Papa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda said that she was Russian, they said, well let you go, we arent touching the Russians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides shes going to tell them shes Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marinas and Lyudas hands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our sister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbors and starts pounding on the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in there. So they survived. My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things. While they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back up again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed there. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put it on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbors on the fourth floor, the one whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and knocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, ""Im not going to let you in the apartment because Im afraid of them. But Ill give you some stockings and well leave the building."" Lyuda says, ""Ill stay at your place because of whats going on, they keep going up and down the stairs."" It was just for a moment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldnt consent. Lyuda came back to our place and lay under the bed . . . I came to. Mother was there. I cant remember my supervisors telephone number, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he came to get us. He didnt have any idea what was going on. He thought we were simply afraid, he didnt know that they were killing us and that we had passed between life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct. There they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly, it was hard to breathe . . . My supervisors name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. Hes the head of our administration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary passenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right after eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a great many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and what was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not only in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next, without stopping. After us. I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from Buildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died from Building 16, thats the building in front of ours. There young Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldnt let it into their building. Incidentally, when we were at the neighbors, Marina called our relatives to warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in Microdistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, ""Run quickly, I cant explain whats going on; hide, do what you can, just stay alive. Hide at Azerbaijanis, ones who wont give you away."" At that moment three people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such awful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up, there was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything out of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face was pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my normal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to scream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you here, havent you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of the soldiers said, ""Dont scream at us. Were Muslims, but were not from the Sumgait police. They called in from Daghestan."" So at that point the Daghestan police were there. When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there, there were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I dont know, maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously injured to treat them there in the police precinct. I dont know what they were there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda and me and said, ""These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we dont know what to do with the rest."" So they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My boss said, ""Dont worry, Ill find you, no matter where you are, no matter what happens."" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department head from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She examined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait ambulances hadnt done anything, they didnt respond to any calls. People called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life. That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something very good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself, ""God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?"" She looks me over and says, ""Now why are you suffering so? You dont know what your people have been doing, your people did even worse things."" And I think, great, I have to deal with her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why dont I just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this condition and being told about something that our people did. I just didnt have the energy to say, ""How could our people possibly be smart enough to think of something that yours havent already done?"" I stayed there. Then they brought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her own apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next morning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didnt do anything to help us. This was in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didnt do anything more than examine me, that was it. I didnt want any shots or tranquilizer, nothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didnt even want to look at them. I lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur- pose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face was disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, ""Better to ask your brother what happened, theres no point in asking me, your brother can better explain what happened."" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw themselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my ward. Then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me clothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress, but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up above my knees, and the woman orderly said, ""I cant believe you put on such a short dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?"" I went back to my ward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and brought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I couldnt take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said that I couldnt take the apples, and really didnt have any appetite. No one had to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . . Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an Armenian, maybe they wouldnt figure it out from looking at me. So they must have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something else would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on the street, I dont know. In any case, I didnt sleep a wink that night. The next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus, and off we went. I didnt even know where they were taking me. They took me to the club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening. I got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw a few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought that I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait after that night. I still didnt know what happened to my parents, they didnt come to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine. I didnt know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm me down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw a lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each other and asking, ""What happened, what went on?"" Two days later they came to see me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed interest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they could. Of course Im most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues who didnt lose his presence of mind and who didnt change his opinions, neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what happened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart . . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came, not from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part of, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements with the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by myself I couldnt get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my lungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I lay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be from all the blows, I dont know. They didnt diagnose anything in particular. When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful. There was no way something inside wasnt broken, my ribs . . . Well they took me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were emergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marinas friends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Childrens Clinic. They had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I needed at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty breathing, I couldnt seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me. They put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some people saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I wasnt cut. They took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon appeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not talk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, ""We demand that Seidov come!"" The response was, ""Its Seidov who sent us."" Seidov is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said, ""Well only see Seidovs daughter, have her come here, well do the same things to her that they did to our daughters, and then well deal with you agitators."" And so on. More of them said, ""Have Seidov himself come."" This went on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us out of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because they realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The smell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who had literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a club that didnt even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay to eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day someone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill. Everything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie theater with seating for no more than 500. You couldnt sit or lie down, it was impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants took ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in Yerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to mention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting right and left. I just dont know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only the young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women were in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come any minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered together purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie theater and there wouldnt be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to the attic. I didnt see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and couldnt get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently they caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the theater. Maybe someone saw them, I didnt. I was in no condition to open my eyes. Everyone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, ""Arent you an Azerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think youre an Azerbaijani."" They led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their passports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did not have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in nothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like they should have, with their IDs. So on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On Monday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didnt spare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed, they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered the Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter- in-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only the two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself, she ran away, the neighbors wouldnt take her in, so she ran about the building until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children. This all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were already in the city. They murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire families. They say they didnt even know for sure if the people were Armenians or not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. Im not sure myself, I didnt see any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so its very difficult now to say exactly who died and who didnt. It was very difficult to identify the corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in gasoline and burned . . . its all very hard to imagine, of course I heard that many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people, including a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in Microdistrict 3. They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were going home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply savagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that hoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians out and killed them on the spot. I didnt see it myself, but I heard that they put them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from the corpses, well you cant call them corpses, you had to figure out from the ashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira G., if Im not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and she still cant figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that whole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and carried her to the city. I still cant imagine how he managed to do that. I heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of people went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a song in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has that piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song, the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They couldnt find the guy who saved her. He left her in someones apartment and called the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me, she couldnt remember anyones face. I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had talked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked out of my head. I cant remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw the Secretary of the Directorates Party organization, where Marina works. She goes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at the Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. Im the Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint meetings. I know them all, Ive even talked with them, and he, I know, is from Armenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of those people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia. They took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the Procuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden- tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They showed me the people who were in our apartment, theyre working on our case, but I cant even recognize them, although it was proved that they were the ones, theyre processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were dragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch me, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these people, all of them, as much as Ive heard about them and seen them, they were all from Kafan. The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was there when everything started. It must have been him because I didnt recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since I told him, ""Listen, you do something, because you know me."" He turned away and went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldnt see Marina anyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldnt make out anyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became myself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people there. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his name. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one were part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, ""If hes here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his alibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think Im crazy, not responsible for my words."" He said, ""What did they do to you, how awful, myself, I hid an Armenian family."" Then after some time goes by he comes back again and says something entirely different: ""I wasnt at home, my family and I went to Baku."" I said, ""Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally different before."" After that I didnt go to see our Procurator, our case is being handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me that Rzayevs case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved. What are they doing with Rzayev? Did he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the head I cant say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an insult if he was in our apartment and doesnt have to pay for it, but at the same time Im afraid to say Im a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat- ter who I name, they tell me, no, youre wrong, he didnt do that, that one wasnt there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what exactly I cant say. When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didnt see it, because I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got it because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my face I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed, they took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he works at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41, is where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ dormitory is over there, thats where he lives. Now hes in custody, they even have proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the clarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our building was killed, it was that man. A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didnt come over, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was all over, people started making announcements in town saying that investigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now theyve caught him, everythings been proved. Now, evidently, theyve been beating him, I dont know what theyre doing with them over there, but he himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy came to the plant and said, ""Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the bus station on Saturday at ten."" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to, went. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday night. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do you mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent, probably, in their hearts they were thinking, Im going to go. But they didnt say anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go, because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had killed their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of that. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too. from Ive participated in the investigation a couple of times. Im satisfied with them thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word I said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an Armenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I dont know. His last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from Microdistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time. His mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani KGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many photographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at curfew, and Ive got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this, the guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a haystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he is so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I dont know what he did, I cant remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment. At the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, theres no need for this, all this stuff, look me in the eyes, youre like a sister to me. I took a look at him and thought, ""My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like you."" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything without great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when she came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over the table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the balcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had all kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters. They stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that moment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the faces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the apartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when Ive got three kids and no place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didnt have anywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the apartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the apartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. Thats what they said. How did they know there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that Armenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the building, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis lived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didnt set fire to our apartment. I dont know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt when I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would have said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but probably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at a free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were being fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have been fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from our building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, ""Karina, we saw all of it, how could it happen?"" Theyre asking me! Well I just dont know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to me. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldnt have been able to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani woman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated woman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two Armenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She came down to the entryway and said, ""Youll come in this entryway over my dead body."" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didnt even know what they were doing. I dont think thats true. They knew very well what they were doing if they didnt even lift a hand against that woman. They couldnt have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani stopped them. They were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place they were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the apartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that? Maybe Im losing my mind? But no, theyre all chewing something. Maybe it is some kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed to be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had come to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They didnt talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They screamed and screamed: ""Yeah, killing, killing, were killing the Armenians!"" Only they didnt shout ""kill,"" they shouted ""gurun ermianlary."" Gurun literally means ""kill,"" or ""destroy."" Thats how it was! Ill continue. We hid in a captains apartment, hes an Azerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their kids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part of the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldnt find Lyuda she took Papas hand, this was while the looters were stealing things, but they didnt pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the courage to . . . A boy said to my mother ""Wheres the gold?"" Mamma said he must have been 12 to 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the fair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where the gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a little black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesnt really like to wear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were bought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma thinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and Mamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth, bound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and tore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having trouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted to open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by accident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake, ""Whats happened?"" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, ""At least go and find out whats happening to my daughters, even if theyve burned them or murdered them, at least bring the corpses."" He went looking for us. At that moment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that someone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldnt get out from under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought she was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to herself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from under the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost her mind. Ill never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that way to me, Ill come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled down, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from outside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I dont remember what order it happened in. And Mamma said, ""Listen, theyre all running around down there, shouting something or other, and running toward the other building."" It had more or less calmed down where we were. Whos dead, whos alive, we dont know. I tried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, ""Listen; lets go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We dont know how long well be here. Maybe they didnt burn everything."" I dont get it, all women have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe not everything was taken? I tell Mamma, ""Mamma, what do you need any of that for? To hell with it! Were alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!"" She says, ""No, lets go get at least something. Maybe well leave here, spend the night at someone elses."" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son Alik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were coming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He shouts, ""Come back, theyre coming!"" They didnt have enough time to get a lot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my knitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore, out of the hall . . . Someone took Fathers old coveralls. The neighbor, his wife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to leave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs, theyre dragging something again. They were going toward the other building, maybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over there, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished building, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more or less calmed down. I tried to call my boss. Later there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom apartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor, Asya Dallakian. Shes an old woman, retired. She wasnt at home, at that time she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and her grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started pounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there, something like that, shes a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even live there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and mattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television. They started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, ""My God, what is going on around here? When will this end?"" We turned off the lights and sat. As it turns out the people who werent afraid, the ones who knew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didnt know, but they didnt come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that he was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his apartment. His last name was Kasumov. Hes an exserviceman, retired, works up at the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door. They tell him, ""Comrade Captain, dont worry, we wont harm you, youre one of us."" He went upstairs, and they say, ""Arent you taking anything from this apartment?"" He says, ""I dont need anything."" And the women who were standing in the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were standing in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the first floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time to into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty pillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really mad, and he says, ""Wheres the rug? I just put it right here!"" They tell him, ""Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school."" He ran off in that direction. Oh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms, there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They just didnt tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man, she didnt want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told me, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them, the ringleader, apparently a young man, said, ""Wheres the girl who was here?"" And he became furious. The woman tells him, ""She came to . . . "" She didnt know what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would comb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, ""She came to and went to the basement."" Now, our basement is full of water. So the whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took flashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been standing there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there to get me. Then one of them said, ""Theres so much water down there, she probably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in the basement. Thats it, we can leave, no problem!"" I didnt know that, and when I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didnt just want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . . After that we of course didnt want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really didnt want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and started to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all. Although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people who sat in their apartments and didnt help us at a time like that. I think that they could have helped! I dont think that they were obligated to, but they could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole brutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been enough foe one man or women to say, What do you think youre doing?"" Thats all! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not one person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were standing on their balconies I didnt hear anyones voice, no one said what are you doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a bomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for one of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway, an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom: if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed to stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they stomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, ""If you want to go on living, youll disappear into your apartment."" So she left. That trick didnt work on them. Even the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget that it happened. I said Id only forget it if I told them right then that it had happened to their daughter--and if that didnt have any effect on them, then I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister. And no one did anything. Anything.

Ave., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA +1 (617) 876-3296 Lines: 993 NNTP-Posting-Host: life.ai.mit.edu THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary (Vancouver, British Columbia) ______________________________________________________________ BACKGROUND BRIEFING BY SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS April 4, 1993 Canada Place Vancouver, British Columbia 9:40 A.M. PST Folks, were about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING on the aid package. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Good morning. The President -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed yesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic and political reform in Russia, and its valued at $1.6 billion. Before taking your questions and running through the basic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points. First, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do with available funds to support Russian reform. All of the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress. There is no need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund any of these programs. All our Fiscal Year 93 funds currently are available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin tomorrow. The second point is that this package is designed to support Russian reformers. All of the initiatives in the package are directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have been worked out with prior consultation with the Russian government. Third, the President is determined that we will deliver on these commitments this year. The package is designed to maximize our ability to support reform. In designing it we wanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we feel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in front of you. Fourth, Id like to note the special importance of trade and investment. I think its fair to say that Russias capital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend well into the hundreds of billions of dollars. No collection of governments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do so. And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make trade and investment a major priority in the relationship. They also agreed that there would be a new joint commission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by Vice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. And the goal of this effort is to break through the barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote a vastly expanded relationship. If it would be helpful Id be prepared to run down the first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just give you some general background on what these programs are. Ill do it quickly and then Ill be glad to take questions. The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food and medical assistance. This is part of our effort which has been underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian grant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure theres at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the major cities. Thats $194 million in grant -- that is from Food for Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress. Well also be continuing our grant assistance in medicines and pharmaceutical supplies, and thats $30 million. The second item is concessional food sales. As you know, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship with Russia. Its important to us and its important to Russia that we continue that relationship. The President has chosen the Food for Progress program which is a concessional loan program. The value over the next seven months is $700 million. These are concessional terms. The exact terms have not been worked out, but I think its fair to say there will be a grace period on principal of six or seven years, and concessional rates thereafter for the life of the deal. The third program is a collection of private sector support. We think this is one of the most important things were going to do. Privatization and the creation of small businesses is the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow. And so the President has decided to create a Russian-American enterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million. And the goal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in Russia, to take equity positions in those businesses. The President has also decided to create a privatization fund which would work directly with the Russian government in its priority objective of trying to convert state enterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis. He has also agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a Eurasia foundation. This would be a private foundation led by prominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia. The fourth grouping you see there in the summary page is democratization itself. I think its fair to say that this administration has given a new impetus to the goal of pursuing democratization in Russia. You see that we have a total of $48 million in programs, various programs. The detailed tables give an indication of some of the programs that were launching. The President is also calling for the development of a democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to try to incorporate all of the disparate private and public efforts now underway from the United States to support reform in Russia. The fifth program you see is Russian office of resettlement. This is a new initiative created and conceptualized by this administration. This is a demonstration project. What wed like to do is work with the Russian military to help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic states and other parts of the former Soviet Union. We want to make sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether its with Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American construction. And so weve decided to fund on a demonstration basis the construction of 450 housing units. Well be working very closely with the Russian military on this. And I would say that we have a long-term commitment to this project. The sixth area is energy in the environment. They are two issues that the President feels strongly about. Our initial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the possibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and gas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in the oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much environmental damage. Ive talked a little bit about trade and investment, about the new group being created that the Vice President will chair on our side. Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing with Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development committee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy, to break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede trade and investment. We are also going to appoint a full-time investment ombudsman in the American government to work on this problem full-time. And the point Id like to make here is, trade and investment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an analogy, as arms reductions was in the 70s and 80s. And we just thought that in looking at this we needed to make a commitment within our own government to have people work on it -- senior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly important. Youll notice that the United States is going to support Russias membership in the GATT. Russia has had observer status. Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested our advice in becoming a member of the GATT. We think that the long-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is paramount, a very important goal. And that is why we are supporting the membership in the GATT. We are also supporting their access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences. Youll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in credit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended $150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil project. Id like to emphasize that we are very close to an agreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion framework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance Russian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services. We think this is a very important development. We think well get there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo conference, the G-7 conference. Before I take any further questions, Id like to defer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance objectives with you. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Our major unfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and secure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory under the terms of the START I and START II agreements. Recently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important agreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding to three important programs. The first is the program of $130 million for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement program. That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for bomber dismantlement -- $130 million. The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for the construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed from the warheads as they are dismantled. This will essentially contribute to the overall design and the early phases of the construction of that storage facility. And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help in the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear materials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system. So we add that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance which has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall safety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety measures that we have been working out with the Russians over the last couple of years. So this is an area where we will be going a lot more work with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks, and Belarussians. Belarus, for example, has just, in the last couple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY93 funds for safety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian territory. And this was in the wake of their ratification of START I, an agreement to accede to NPT. So we are working very hard with all the parties to the Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with them. And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia as a very important step in that process. Q The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in Kazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with Kazhakstan. Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if its the same one, why do you feel its necessary? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Its not the same deal. Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil field. This is a new investment project. Its a polar lights oil development and renovation project, and its being announced today. So its completely new. Q Can you tell us more about whats involved? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes. Conoco, like other American oil companies has been searching for ways to do two things. One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west Siberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating oil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia. The objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the natural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which will, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what Russia needs. So we think this deal is very, very good development for Russia. The Russians do as well, and its good for an American company. And the American government has played a leading role in pulling this together through the credit facility in OPIC and through the loan guarantee. Q So its to search and also to renovate fields that are already there? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thats right. Q On that point, should other American companies expect to get administration support for such deals, or should they now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2 billion? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, as you know, Ex-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the U.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department and the White House for this deal to be consummated. And we think it will. And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th, there will be $2 billion in financing available for American companies to sell their equipment and sell their services. Q That should take up all of the rest of the deals and their wont be -- and their will or there wont be support for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Theres a tremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas companies to invest in Russia. We think that the Ex-Im oil and gas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will soak up a lot of that interest. But I think the interest may even extend beyond that. And if so, the government will respond. Q Whats the current year budget costs of that $2-billion agreement should it go forward? And is there any current year budget costs -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Ill have to refer you to Ex-Im for that. I dont know the details of that. Q The concessional food sales -- is there any current year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in which the payments are due? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The concessional food sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program. USDA has the funds, we dont need to go back to the Congress to expend those funds. There will be a hit in the budget. Id refer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that. Q Can you talk about the Democracy Corps? Q and the private sector -- how many folks are going to be involved in that? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Why dont I start with the Democracy Corps first. I think the administration felt coming into office that there were literally thousands of organization, private organizations in the United States that in one way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve democratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis. And there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that had a variety of programs in this area. And so the administration felt -- the President felt it was important to try to draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give some coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the efforts. And so this is a presidential initiative. It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will soon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in the former Soviet Union. And were very hopeful that we might use this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of our own government, but the resources of the American private sector and schools and communities across the nation. Q any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word yet on FY94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated besides the $300 million the President talked about? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The administration is requesting additional funds in FY94 of $700 million. What the President has done this weekend is to consult really intensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional measures the United States could take in some of these areas to support reform. Hell be consulting with the Congress. When he returns to Washington, hell be consulting also with the other ally governments, and well make a decision at that time. Q Two questions about the $700 billion agricultural money. First of all, I thought it was the sort of consensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food. So why did you decide to do it that way? Secondly, could you explain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans for food because of Russias inability to pay. How does this fit into that situation? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: As you know, the United States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains and food commodities, agricultural products to Russia. I think between 1991 and 92 we had extended -- a little bit of history here -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through the Commodity Credit Corporation. That was the principal vehicle to ensure the sale of American grain products. On December 1 of last year, 92, the Russian government stopped its payments on that program. They are now in arrears to us on that program, and therefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that program. And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and other officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we could promote American grain sales. And I think we have two ways to do that. Weve announced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the Food for Progress program. But we do not have sufficient authority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked for a concessional loan program. I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a short-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but a long-term concessional loan program would. And that is what this program is. It will provide, once the final details are worked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of principal. And then from years seven through 15, which is the life of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of interest -- generally around three to four percent. And so we believe and the Russian government believes this is a good deal for them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments and put them into the out years, but it will also continue this very important grain relationship, which is important for them, and its important for the American farm community. Q I gather from what you say that this could make it explicit -- the Russians failure to pay the interest on ECC loan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through, is that right? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Let me be explicit about that. We are prevented under the law to from continuing the Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program because of Russias arrearages to the United States. All of you know about those arrearages. They total about, I think, around $640 million. USDA can give you an exact figure. So having taken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American market share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to respond to a specific request from the Russian government for major food assistance, knowing that we couldnt take it from the grant programs because we dont have sufficient authority there, we looked at Food for Progress, which is a program weve used to great effect in other parts of the world. And we consulted with the Russian government and arrived at this solution. I think the Russians are pleased because it provides them with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on the short-term payments. Q Where do those funds actually come from? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: They come from the Food for Progress program, which is a program under USDAs authority. USDA has the authority to spend these funds. We do not need to go back to the Congress for these funds. And I want to make that general point again: Everything in this package, the $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been allocated and appropriated by the Congress. The administration can begin to spend these monies tomorrow. And its very important in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year, that we meet these commitments. And we are confident well be able to do so. Q How did you arrive at the figure of $700 million -- does that max out that program, or did you actually have a range from 0 to -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Theres a reason for it. The reason was that the Russian government told us thats about the amount of grain that they needed between now and harvest time. And so the idea is that we would begin the shipments probably $100 million per month from now until the harvest in the autumn, at which time Russia wont require the same level of food imports from the West. Q I would imagine theres going to be some considerable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other republics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia. Have you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for the same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with some of the other republics? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, were very conscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending American support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet Union. We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the area of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that you see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and roughly 50 percent to the other countries. In the area of food sales, we have been active with Ukraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia. We will continue that. And I think its fair to say that after this summit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the other countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are productive and theyre hard-hitting. Q Has anything happened at the summit to lead American energy companies and other companies to believe that Russia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of taxing, legalities, bureaucracy? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, one of our primary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight, not only the economic agenda, but also trade and investment. And Id like to refer to the point I made at the beginning. Were convinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to support Russia long-term -- were convinced that no collection of Western governments have the financial resources over the next decade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private sector can do that. We look at our own society and we see tremendous capability in resources in the oil and gas sector. It is a very good match with what the Russians need now, which is financial investment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new technology and new capital to finance new production. Thats what the Russian government has told us it wants to do, and so thats why we have made such a major emphasis on it. Thats why trade and investment was a prominent issue on the first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently last night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President Clinton. And were hoping that together we might send a strong signal to the American business community that we support their efforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex- Im and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to support them. Q My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to deliver on making Russia a more -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We think he is. I would note that President Yeltsins Prime Minister, Mr. Chernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas sector. He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice President, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the barriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil and gas sector. We believe we have a commitment to make that committee an important committee. And were looking forward to the work. Q What type of mechanism is already in place to administer the private sector portion of the program? And will the U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of the actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the Russian government for distribution at their will? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Are you talking about the variety of programs listed here? It depends on the program itself. In most cases, though, we are either working through American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure that the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to the intended source. Thats an obligation we have to the Congress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can account for the money. We have done that in the last couple of months intensively and we will continue to do it for each of these programs. But they are all quite different. For instance, in the area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it is carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of the food. For grant medical assistance, weve been working through Project Hope which is a private organization. For the housing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers, well be working with a group of American PBOs. On some of the democratization projects, were working directly with Russian private individuals and private foundations. Were working with journalists in Russia on a media project that you may have noticed. So we literally have here 30 to 40 different activities under all these rubrics and theyre all going to be carried out in slightly different ways. Some directly with the Russian government, some with Russian citizens. Q The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and on the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the President has to do on that? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, as George noted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in the relationship. The President has noted that. I think its fair to say we will go back now in our own government when we return to Washington and look at both of these questions, and well get back to the Russian government. Q You were not prepared for these questions when you got here? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We were prepared for these questions. Weve looked at them. But were not prepared to make a quick decision this weekend. They require -- let me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik. They require consultation with the Congress. They require consultation with the American Jewish community. And were very sensitive to those concerns. And so well want to go back and talk to them before we take any action. Q Is this package designed so that you will not have to go to Congress for anything at this point? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: As I said at the beginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress. So the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to seek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts. In effect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the agencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow. And thats the advantage of this particular initiative. Q If this, as the President says, is a long-term, long-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment heading for Moscow, why arent you talking about going to Congress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are prepared to go to Congress for various things? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think weve been clear about that. The President is discussing this weekend with President Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American funding of additional projects, and ideas that he has. We have a major congressional delegation that left last night, headed by Representative Gephardt and well want to consult with that delegation and other members of Congress before doing anything. And well also want to consult with our allies. So thats where it stands now. Q Weve been told repeatedly that a number of these items represent different or new ways of spending the money already appropriated. Could you just tick off which of these items represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways that it was not previously set to be? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think that weve said that these are all projects that either Congress had allocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were some funds that were left over from FY92. And this administration took office and had some new ideas about how the funds might be expended. We didnt use just the Freedom Support Act funds or the FY92 funds. We went into some of the agency allocations -- Ex-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to further our programs. And example of that is the Food for Progress concessional loans. We had hit a brick wall with another type of funding through USDA. We could not go forward legally, and so we looked for a more creative way to ensure continued American market share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we found it. Q Where, for example, are you getting the money for this Russian officer resettlement -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thats from the Freedom Support Act funds. Q In other words, all of the money is being directly spent in new ways, so to speak -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Most of the grant projects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the second chart, its broken down into grant and credits. And if you look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that total $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act funding. A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year 92. The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the legislative history of those funds. Q cooperation -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: From FY 92? I dont have the exact figure. It was not a considerable figure. Q Could you tell us please, has anything happened here this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and Russia over START -- for START I and II as a result of whats happened here -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Both presidents, President Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this issue this morning. In fact, we havent yet gotten to security and arms control related issues. That will be this mornings session. I know that President Clinton will be very strongly reinforcing that this is a top priority for us. Weve been talking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple of weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the discussions between them. Up to this point, this has been a very important negotiation thats been going on essentially between Moscow and Kiev. And we are at the point now of essentially discussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute to this discussion, help to move things forward essentially. But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend, I dont yet know. In a couple hours well know. Q? Just a follow-up on the financing here. Is any of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since its all current year appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace thats been earmarked and put it into this fund? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: There are smoke and mirrors here, and I think its an important point to note. We could have given you a page of assistance numbers that included out-year funding. Were going to make a long-term commitment to many of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the privatization effort, the housing effort. And weve already talked to the Russians about our long-term commitment. We could have put in really big numbers and this could have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point: This package is FY 93. Its funds that we have. And were going to do what we say were going to do. And the President feels very strongly about that. In the past there is a legacy that the western governments, the combination of governments, put up large budget figures and for any number of reasons were not able to meet them, were determined, and the President is determined, to carry out every single program in this package. And well do it. But we do have a longer-term commitment, and thats part of the discussions on economics this weekend. Were looking for Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively support reform. And weve told them that we do have a commitment on some of these programs beyond this fiscal year. Q taken it way from any -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, we havent. Okay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds; so have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in Russia? The answer is no, we have not done so. Q In terms of funding, there is no available monies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money somewhere else. Doesnt that, in fact, support the -- theory? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Not at all. I dont think it does. Thats a particular example, and the example is grain sales. The Commodity Credit Corporation credit guarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay back within 12 to 15 months. You all know about Russias debt problem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments. So we looked for a way to do two things: to meet Russias requirement for grain. Theyre a net grain importer on a massive scale, and also meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers have a chance to sell their products to Russia. And we simply look for another way to finance that. And we have legislative authority to do it. This program has been successful in other areas. We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union, but we thought we should now. Q Isnt this really the Bush-Clinton aid package for Russia, since these funds were really first derived by initiatives put forward by President Bush? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, I dont think thats a fair characterization. A lot of these funds were appropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992. This administration took office and inherited some obligations that the Bush administration had made. But we had a long six to seven week review of this program. We decided to meet the commitments that had been made by the previous administration. But we have gone well beyond them in funding the enterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not been filled out with a program. There was no number attached to it. In grouping together some projects and trying to make them into a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say, is another Clinton initiative. Further, we listened to the Russian government and listened to the Russian military who told us that the resettlement of their officers was important to them for political and economic and social reasons. And President Clinton has responded to that. And we are making a long-term commitment that beyond this demonstration project were going to figure out a way to do much more in trying to settle those officers. I would also say that the President has given impetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly about what it is we can do on democratization, because there we have some experience and some comparative advantage that lends itself to the Russian experience. And in calling for the creation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative, were hopeful that we can take the resources of the private sector as well as the American government, to achieve that objective. So I would not characterize it that way at all. And as most of you know, I am a career civil servant. I was in the last administration. Im very familiar with what the last administration did. And I would characterize this as a Clinton assistance package for Russia. Q Theres been a lot of criticism that aid in the past has not gotten to the people. Is there anything in this outside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money will not just disappear because its being administered by the Russian government? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think that -- I know that the President and other senior officials of our government are concerned that American money be spent wisely and that it get to the source that its intended -- for which its intended. And so were going to take great care -- AID and the State Department will take great care in making sure that the funds are expended properly and that theyre reaching their source. I would not that this package is not simply a package of support solely to the Russian government. Some of these projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are going to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals, with businesses. The private enterprise support is another example of that. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: If I could just add a word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one area that weve been looking at very, very closely is consideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting for these kinds of programs. They would be working very closely, of course, with the American firms, who would be the prime contractors. But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of a imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that funding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in Russia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent efficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended. Q When would the democracy corps start? Exactly when do you see this happening? How would get it off the ground? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, the President is today calling for the creation of a democracy corps. I think its fair to say that were going to work out its framework over the next couple of weeks. Ambassador Simons takes up his duties on May 1st. But in effect weve already started, because over the last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach out to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us to help facilitate their activities in Russia. And weve said that we will be helpful. Weve also tried to kind of coordinate in a much more effective way the activities of our own government. We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in Russia in one way or another. We think it makes sense to draw them together and to focus their efforts. Q Excuse me. How much of this $1.6 billion will actually be spent in the United States by American made goods? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I dont have any figures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something up in the next couple of days on that. Q This figure is larger than the figure that has been in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result of the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, I think -- unfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and Im sorry to say that. No, this package -- President Clinton put us to work about seven weeks ago on this package. And he was briefed intensively on this. He contributed a lot of the intellectual leadership in this package. He contributed a lot of the ideas in the package. And I think its fair to say that we had this rough package worked out about two weeks ago. We have been refining it ever since. We spent a couple of days last week going over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in Washington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy. And so its been evolving. But this particular package has been together for about two weeks. Q Where is Yeltsins input into this then? There was so much talk before about the President wanted to get Yeltsins views about specifically what was needed and so forth. Is that in the out years? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: No, its both. President Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance, that support for the creation of private businesses is important to him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is important; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize the state industries is important to them. And so what we did was to try to make those the centerpiece of our technical assistance part o the package. We listened to him. On the privatization effort, we have been working with the Russian government for months on this trying to work out all the details. So the Russian government on most of these programs was involved every step of the way. But let me get at the other part of your question. The President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader set of initiatives that we might undertake. And were looking for his ideas. The President has brought his own ideas to the table -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in housing. But were looking for Russian ideas not. We need to consult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other allied governments that are also active. Q Theres essentially nothing that happened in the last day and a half that measurably altered the package that you came in with? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: This particular package, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks ago. We have since then consulted with the Russian government on the final stages of its development, and so this weekend weve primarily talked about future, about what more the United States and other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia, which is our base objective here. Q I noticed that you -- that money appropriated to train bankers and businessmen and officers. Can you tell me what about job training for workers who are displaced by privatization? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Youre right; we have a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and financial services in the United States. Part of the housing initiative, its not just to build housing units, its to retrain Russian officers who are retiring into other professions. Q money for job training for workers whose jobs are disappearing because of privatization -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We have not yet allocated any money for that. Q Why not? Q of the $6 million is going to build 450 housing units. Isnt that a lot of money per unit given what the Western dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: If you want to do housing the right way, its not just the building the framework of a house, youve got to think about all the utilities. Youve got to think about the purchase of land. Youve got to think about sewage and gas and electricity and so forth. And its also retraining. Its not enough to put retired -- an officer coming out of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia. We think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers as well. This is responding to a request from the Russian government. Q of the $6 million will go to retrain -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thats right. Q Are you talking about apartment buildings or single -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Were talking about single, individual dwellings. Q Youre saying that only 450 families will be served by this? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: What I want to -- I thought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project. What we didnt want to do -- given the experience that the Germans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building housing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with a huge amount of money. What we want to do is work over the next couple of months and try to figure out with American organizations in the private sector the best way to get this job done. I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that. And so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into this in the future . But we want to do it wisely; we want to spend the money wisely. Q What is it about this program that convinces you that it will protect Russias reforms and that Russia will be in a position to may back the money theyre supposed to pay back, especially considering their other debt problem? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, look, I think its important to note that the United States on its own does not have the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform. Its got to be a collective Western effort, and were looking to our allies to do more as well. But beyond that, its really what the Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform. We can simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do so, which is consistent with our national interests. Q Did the President say that the value of the U.S. contribution was that it would create security and prosperity for the United States? So what is it about this program that does this? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think you have to go back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia, and that is we want to do everything we can to support the continuation of reform. We are convinced that if reformers stay in power, then well be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear forces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction, which are the three benefits to the United States from reform in Russia. So its not a simple question. You cant just say that this program is the answer. Its a long-term question and we have to make a long-term commitment to it. Q And then on the question of Russias ability to repay, what convinces you theyll be able to pay seven to 15 years from now? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, the Russian government has made a commitment to repay, and what were hoping is that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve their oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency revenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years from now to pay back those loans. Q substantial government-to-government loan weve ever gotten into with the Russians? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I dont want to answer authoritatively on that. I dont go back 20 or 30 years on this. But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because the previous way that we financed grain exports was really to just ensure private bank loans. This is a different type of effort. Q government loans in any other sector that you recall? I know it wasnt done in -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think its fair to say this is a new and unique effort. END10:25 A.M. PDT "

Although some books demonstrate that the current implementation of Xt happens to call callback procedures in the order in which they are registered, the specification does not guarantee such a sequence, and supplemental authoritative documents (i.e. the Asente/Swick volume) do say that the order is undefined. Because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget and the application, Xt cannot guarantee the order of execution. In general, the callback procedures should be thought of as operating independently of one another and should not depend on side-effects of other callbacks operating; if a seqence is needed, then the single callback to be registered can explicitly call other functions necessary. [4/92; thanks to ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 122) Why doesnt XtDestroyWidget() actually destroy the widget? XtDestroyWidget() operates in two passes, in order to avoid leaving dangling data structures; the function-call marks the widget, which is not actually destroyed until your program returns to its event-loop. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 123) How do I query the user synchronously using Xt? It is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback, which has a clear flow of control. The calls to AskUser() block until answer is set to one of the valid values. If it is not a ""yes"" answer, the code drops out of the callback and back to an event-processing loop: void quit(Widget w, XtPointer client, XtPointer call) { int answer; answer = AskUser(w, ""Really Quit?""); if (RET_YES == answer) { answer = AskUser(w, ""Are You Really Positive?""); if (RET_YES == answer) exit(0); } } A more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether to overwrite it. This is accomplished by entering a second event-processing loop and waiting until the user answers the question; the answer is returned to the calling function. That function AskUser() looks something like this, where the Motif can be replaced with widget-set-specific code to create some sort of dialog-box displaying the question string and buttons for ""OK"", ""Cancel"" and ""Help"" or equivalents: int AskUser(w, string) Widget w; char *string; { int answer=RET_NONE; /* some not-used marker */ Widget dialog; /* could cache&carry, but ...*/ Arg args[3]; int n = 0; XtAppContext context; n=0; XtSetArg(args[n], XmNmessageString, XmStringCreateLtoR(string, XmSTRING_DEFAULT_CHARSET)); n++; XtSetArg(args[n], XmNdialogStyle, XmDIALOG_APPLICATION_MODAL); n++; dialog = XmCreateQuestionDialog(XtParent(w), string, args, n); XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNokCallback, response, &answer); XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNcancelCallback, response, &answer); XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNhelpCallback, response, &answer); XtManageChild(dialog); context = XtWidgetToApplicationContext (w); while (answer == RET_NONE || XtAppPending(context)) { XtAppProcessEvent (context, XtIMAll); } XtDestroyWidget(dialog); /* blow away the dialog box and shell */ return answer; } The dialog supports three buttons, which are set to call the same function when tickled by the user. The variable answer is set when the user finally selects one of those choices: void response(w, client, call) Widget w; XtPointer client; XtPointer call; { int *answer = (int *) client; XmAnyCallbackStruct *reason = (XmAnyCallbackStruct *) call; switch (reason->reason) { case XmCR_OK: *answer = RET_YES; /* some #define value */ break; case XmCR_CANCEL: *answer = RET_NO; break; case XmCR_HELP: *answer = RET_HELP; break; default: return; } } and the code unwraps back to the point at which an answer was needed and continues from there. [Thanks to Dan Heller further code is in Dans R3/contrib WidgetWrap library. 2/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 124) How do I determine the name of an existing widget? I have a widget ID and need to know what the name of that widget is. Users of R4 and later are best off using the XtName() function, which will work on both widgets and non-widget objects. If you are still using R3, you can use this simple bit of code to do what you want. Note that it depends on the widgets internal data structures and is not necessarily portable to future versions of Xt, including R4. #include <X11/CoreP.h> #include <X11/Xresource.h> String XtName (widget) Widget widget; /* WILL work with non-widget objects */ { return XrmNameToString(widget->core.xrm_name); } [7/90; modified with suggestion by Larry Rogers 9/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 125) Why do I get a BadDrawable error drawing to XtWindow(widget)? Im doing this in order to get a window into which I can do Xlib graphics within my Xt-based program: > canvas = XtCreateManagedWidget ( ...,widgetClass,...) /* drawing area */ > ... > window = XtWindow(canvas); /* get the window associated with the widget */ > ... > XDrawLine (...,window,...); /* produces error */ The window associated with the widget is created as a part of the realization of the widget. Using a window id of NULL (""no window"") could create the error that you describe. It is necessary to call XtRealizeWidget() before attempting to use the window associated with a widget. Note that the window will be created after the XtRealizeWidget() call, but that the server may not have actually mapped it yet, so you should also wait for an Expose event on the window before drawing into it. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 126) Why do I get a BadMatch error when calling XGetImage? The BadMatch error can occur if the specified rectangle goes off the edge of the screen. If you dont want to catch the error and deal with it, you can take the following steps to avoid the error: 1) Make a pixmap the same size as the rectangle you want to capture. 2) Clear the pixmap to background using XFillRectangle. 3) Use XCopyArea to copy the window to the pixmap. 4) If you get a NoExpose event, the copy was clean. Use XGetImage to grab the image from the pixmap. 5) If you get one or more GraphicsExpose events, the copy wasnt clean, and the x/y/width/height members of the GraphicsExpose event structures tell you the parts of the pixmap which arent good. 6) Get rid of the pixmap; it probably takes a lot of memory. [10/92; thanks to Oliver Jones ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 127) How can my application tell if it is being run under X? A number of programs offer X modes but otherwise run in a straight character-only mode. The easiest way for an application to determine that it is running on an X display is to attempt to open a connection to the X server: display = XOpenDisplay(display_name); if (display) { do X stuff } else { do curses or something else } where display_name is either the string specified on the command-line following -display, by convention, or otherwise is (char*)NULL [in which case XOpenDisplay uses the value of $DISPLAY, if set]. This is superior to simply checking for the existence a -display command-line argument or checking for $DISPLAY set in the environment, neither of which is adequate. [5/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 128) How do I make a ""busy cursor"" while my application is computing? Is it necessary to call XDefineCursor() for every window in my application? The easiest thing to do is to create a single InputOnly window that is as large as the largest possible screen; make it a child of your toplevel window and it will be clipped to that window, so it wont affect any other application. (It needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the user enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual desktop.) Substitute ""toplevel"" with your top-most widget here (similar code should work for Xlib-only applications; just use your top Window): unsigned long valuemask; XSetWindowAttributes attributes; /* Ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed. */ valuemask = CWDontPropagate | CWCursor; attributes.do_not_propagate_mask = (KeyPressMask | KeyReleaseMask | ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask | PointerMotionMask); attributes.cursor = XCreateFontCursor(XtDisplay(toplevel), XC_watch); /* The window will be as big as the display screen, and clipped by its own parent window, so we never have to worry about resizing */ XCreateWindow(XtDisplay(toplevel), XtWindow(toplevel), 0, 0, 65535, 65535, (unsigned int) 0, 0, InputOnly, CopyFromParent, valuemask, &attributes); where the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen, particularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than 32767. When you want to use this busy cursor, map and raise this window; to go back to normal, unmap it. This will automatically keep you from getting extra mouse events; depending on precisely how the window manager works, it may or may not have a similar effect on keystrokes as well. In addition, note also that most of the Xaw widgets support an XtNcursor resource which can be temporarily reset, should you merely wish to change the cursor without blocking pointer events. [thanks to Andrew Wason Dan Heller and 11/90,5/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 129) How do I fork without hanging my parent X program? An X-based application which spawns off other Unix processes which continue to run after it is closed typically does not vanish until all of its children are terminated; the children inherit from the parent the open X connection to the display. What you need to do is fork; then, immediately, in the child process, close (ConnectionNumber(XtDisplay(widget))); to close the file-descriptor in the display information. After this do your exec. You will then be able to exit the parent. Alternatively, before execing make this call, which causes the file descriptor to be closed on exec. (void) fcntl(ConnectionNumber(XDisplay), F_SETFD, 1); [Thanks to Janet Anstett Gordon Freedman 2/91. Greg Holmberg 3/93.] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 130) Can I make Xt or Xlib calls from a signal handler? No. Xlib and Xt have no mutual exclusion for protecting critical sections. If your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time (which might be while the function you are calling is already executing), it can leave the library in an inconsistent state. Note that the ANSI C standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions. You can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupt handler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event which has previously been added. Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in OReilly Volume 6 are in error. [Thanks to Pete Ware and Donna Converse 5/92] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 131) What are these ""Xlib sequence lost"" errors? You may see these errors if you issue Xlib requests from an Xlib error handler, or, more likely, if you make calls which generate X requests to Xt or Xlib from a signal handler, which you shouldnt be doing in any case. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 132) How can my Xt program handle socket, pipe, or file input? Its very common to need to write an Xt program that can accept input both from a user via the X connection and from some other file descriptor, but which operates efficiently and without blocking on either the X connection or the other file descriptor. A solution is use XtAppAddInput(). After you open your file descriptor, use XtAppAddInput() to register an input handler. The input handler will be called every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your programs attention. Write the input handler like you would any other Xt callback, so it does its work quickly and returns. It is important to use only non-blocking I/O system calls in your input handlers. Most input handlers read the file descriptor, although you can have an input handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish. Be careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file. You will find that the function is called even when there isnt input pending. XtAppAddInput() is actually working as it is supposed to. The input handler is called whenever the file descriptor is READY to be read, not only when there is new data to be read. A disk file (unlike a pipe or socket) is almost always ready to be read, however, if only because you can spin back to the beginning and read data youve read before. The result is that your function will almost always be called every time around XtAppMainLoop(). There is a way to get the type of interaction you are expecting; add this line to the beginning of your function to test whether there is new data: if (ioctl(fd, FIONREAD, &n) == -1 || n == 0) return; But, because this is called frequently, your application is effectively in a busy-wait; you may be better off not using XtAppAddInput() and instead setting a timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input. [courtesy Dan Heller 8/90; 5/91; Ollie Jones 6/92] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 133) How do I simulate a button press/release event for a widget? You can do this using XSendEvent(); its likely that youre not setting the window field in the event, which Xt needs in order to match to the widget which should receive the event. If youre sending events to your own application, then you can use XtDispatchEvent() instead. This is more efficient than XSendEvent() in that you avoid a round-trip to the server. Depending on how well the widget was written, you may be able to call its action procedures in order to get the effects you want. [courtesy Mark A. Horstman 11/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 134) Why doesnt anything appear when I run this simple program? > ... > the_window = XCreateSimpleWindow(the_display, > root_window,size_hints.x,size_hints.y, > size_hints.width,size_hints.height,BORDER_WIDTH, > BlackPixel(the_display,the_screen), > WhitePixel(the_display,the_screen)); > ... > XSelectInput(the_display,the_window,ExposureMask|ButtonPressMask| > ButtonReleaseMask); > XMapWindow(the_display,the_window); > ... > XDrawLine(the_display,the_window,the_GC,5,5,100,100); > ... You are right to map the window before drawing into it. However, the window is not ready to be drawn into until it actually appears on the screen -- until your application receives an Expose event. Drawing done before that will generally not appear. Youll see code like this in many programs; this code would appear after window was created and mapped: while (!done) { XNextEvent(the_display,&the_event); switch (the_event.type) { case Expose: /* On expose events, redraw */ XDrawLine(the_display,the_window,the_GC,5,5,100,100); break; ... } } Note that there is a second problem: some Xlib implementations dont set up the default graphics context to have correct foreground/background colors, so this program could previously include this code: ... the_GC_values.foreground=BlackPixel(the_display,the_screen); /* e.g. */ the_GC_values.background=WhitePixel(the_display,the_screen); /* e.g. */ the_GC = XCreateGC(the_display,the_window, GCForeground|GCBackground,&the_GC_values); ... Note: the code uses BlackPixel and WhitePixel to avoid assuming that 1 is black and 0 is white or vice-versa. The relationship between pixels 0 and 1 and the colors black and white is implementation-dependent. They may be reversed, or they may not even correspond to black and white at all. Also note that actually using BlackPixel and WhitePixel is usually the wrong thing to do in a finished program, as it ignores the users preference for foreground and background. And also note that you can run into the same situation in an Xt-based program if you draw into the XtWindow(w) right after it has been realized; it may not yet have appeared. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 135) What is the difference between a Screen and a screen? The Screen is an Xlib structure which includes the information about one of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single X display supports. A server can support several independent screens. They are numbered unix:0.0, unix:0.1, unix:0.2, etc; the screen or screen_number is the second digit -- the 0, 1, 2 which can be thought of as an index into the array of available Screens on this particular Display connection. The macros which you can use to obtain information about the particular Screen on which your application is running typically have two forms -- one which takes a Screen and one with takes both the Display and the screen_number. In Xt-based programs, you typically use XtScreen(widget) to determine the Screen on which your application is running, if it uses a single screen. (Part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macros which return characteristics of the Screen have ""Display"" in the names -- XDisplayWidth, XDisplayHeight, etc.) ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 136) Can I use C++ with X11? Motif? XView? The X11R4/5 header files are compatible with C++. The Motif 1.1 header files are usable as is inside extern ""C"" {...}. However, the definition of String in Intrinsic.h can conflict with the libg++ or other String class and needs to be worked around.

It works by building a set of C++ classes in parallel to the class tree of the widgets. The C++ InterViews toolkit is obtainable via anonymous FTP from interviews.stanford.edu. InterViews uses a box/glue model similar to that of TeX for constructing user interfaces and supports multiple looks on the user interfaces.

THINGS, a class library written at the Rome Air Force Base by the Strategic Air Command, available as freeware on archive sites. Motif++ is a public-domain library that defines C++ class wrappers for Motif 1.1; it adds an ""application"" class for, e.g., initializing X, and also integrates WCL and the Xbae widget set.

Versions of the CLX Lisp bindings are part of the X11 core source distributions. A version of CLX is on the R5 tape [10/91]; version 5.0.2 [9/92] is on export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/CLX.R5.02.tar.Z. The SAIC Ada-X11 bindings are through anonymous ftp in /pub from stars.rosslyn.unisys.com (128.126.164.2). There is an X/Ada study team sponsored by NASA JSC, which apparently is working out bindings.

No. Once set, the background pixel or pixmap of a window cannot be re-read by clients. The reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap, set it to be the background pixmap of a window, and then free the pixmap. The window keeps this background, but the pixmap itself is destroyed. If youre sure a window has a background pixel (not a pixmap), you can use XClearArea() to clear a region to the background color and then use XGetImage() to read back that pixel. However, this action alters the contents of the window, and it suffers from race conditions with exposures. [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun] Note that the same applies to the border pixel/pixmap. This is a (mis)feature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate the pixel/pixmap however it wants. By not requiring the server to keep the original pixel or pixmap, some (potentially a lot of) space can be saved. [courtesy Jim Fulton, MIT X Consortium] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 139) How do I create a transparent window? A completely transparent window is easy to get -- use an InputOnly window. In order to create a window which is *mostly* transparent, you have several choices: - the SHAPE extension first released with X11R4 offers an easy way to make non-rectangular windows, so you can set the shape of the window to fit the areas where the window should be nontransparent; however, not all servers support the extension. - a machine-specific method of implementing transparent windows for particular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware. Note that there is no X notion of a ""transparent color index"". - a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny windows, but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult. - a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent window or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application window with information; if so, you can draw into separate bitplanes in colors that will appear properly. [thanks to der Mouse, 3/92; see also The X Journal 1:4 for a more complete answer, including code samples for this last option] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 140) Why doesnt GXxor produce mathematically-correct color values? When using GXxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on a background of black, for example, should produce white. However, the drawing operation does not work on RGB values but on colormap indices. The color that the resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visually random unless you have actually filled it in yourself. [On many X servers Black and White often 0/1 or 1/0; programs taking advantage of this mathematical coincidence will break.] If you want to be combining colors with GXxor, then you should be allocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen pre-computed values. If you want to use GXxor simply to switch between two colors, then you can take the shortcut of setting the background color in the GC (graphics context) to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over red, say, the result is blue, and when it draws over blue the result is red. This foreground value is itself the XOR of the colormap indices of red and blue. [Thanks to Chris Flatters and Ken Whaley 2/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 141) Why does every color I allocate show up as black? Make sure youre using 16 bits and not 8. The red, green, and blue fields of an XColor structure are scaled so that 0 is nothing and 65535 is full-blast. If you forget to scale (using, for example, 0-255 for each color) the XAllocColor function will perform correctly but the resulting color is usually black. [Thanks to Paul Asente, 7/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 142) Why cant my program get a standard colormap? I have an image-processing program which uses XGetRGBColormap() to get the standard colormap, but it doesnt work. XGetRGBColormap() when used with the property XA_RGB_DEFAULT_MAP does not create a standard colormap -- it just returns one if one already exists. Use xstdcmap or do what it does in order to create the standard colormap first. [1/91; from der Mouse ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 143) Why does the pixmap I copy to the screen show up as garbage? The initial contents of pixmaps are undefined. This means that most servers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there -- which is usually garbage. You probably want to clear the pixmap first using XFillRectangle() with a function of GXcopy and a foreground pixel of whatever color you want as your background (or 0L if you are using the pixmap as a mask). [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 144) How do I check whether a window ID is valid? My program has the ID of a window on a remote display. I want to check whether the window exists before doing anything with it. Because X is asynchronous, there isnt a guarantee that the window would still exist between the time that you got the ID and the time you sent an event to the window or otherwise manipulated it. What you should do is send the event without checking, but install an error handler to catch any BadWindow errors, which would indicate that the window no longer exists. This scheme will work except on the [rare] occasion that the original window has been destroyed and its ID reallocated to another window. [courtesy Ken Lee 4/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 145) Can I have two applications draw to the same window? Yes. The X server assigns IDs to windows and other resources (actually, the server assigns some bits, the client others), and any application that knows the ID can manipulate the resource [almost any X server resource, except for GCs and private color cells, can be shared]. The problem you face is how to disseminate the window ID to multiple applications. A simple way to handle this (and which solves the problem of the applications running on different machines) is in the first application to create a specially-named property on the root-window and put the window ID into it. The second application then retrieves the property, whose name it also knows, and then can draw whatever it wants into the window. [Note: this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the first application running, and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned in the Question about using window IDs on remote displays.] Note also that you will still need to coordinate any higher-level cooperation among your applications. Note also that two processes can share a window but should not try to use the same server connection. If one process is a child of the other, it should close down the connection to the server and open its own connection. [mostly courtesy Phil Karlton 6/90] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 146) Why cant my program work with tvtwm or swm? A number of applications, including xwd, xwininfo, and xsetroot, do not handle the virtual root window which tvtwm and swm use; they typically return the wrong child of root. A general solution is to add this code or to use it in your own application where you would normally use RootWindow(dpy,screen): /* Function Name: GetVRoot * Description: Gets the root window, even if its a virtual root * Arguments: the display and the screen * Returns: the root window for the client */ #include <X11/Xatom.h> Window GetVRoot(dpy, scr) Display *dpy; int scr; { Window rootReturn, parentReturn, *children; unsigned int numChildren; Window root = RootWindow(dpy, scr); Atom __SWM_VROOT = None; int i; __SWM_VROOT = XInternAtom(dpy, ""__SWM_VROOT"", False); XQueryTree(dpy, root, &rootReturn, &parentReturn, &children, &numChildren); for (i = 0; i < numChildren; i++) { Atom actual_type; int actual_format; long nitems, bytesafter; Window *newRoot = NULL; if (XGetWindowProperty(dpy, children[i], __SWM_VROOT, 0, 1, False, XA_WINDOW, &actual_type, &actual_format, &nitems, &bytesafter, (unsigned char **) &newRoot) == Success && newRoot) { root = *newRoot; break; } } return root; } [courtesy David Elliott Similar code is in ssetroot, a version of xsetroot distributed with tvtwm. 2/91] A header file by Andreas Stolcke of ICSI on export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/vroot.h functions similarly by providing macros for RootWindow and DefaultRootWindow; code can include this header file first to run properly in the presence of a virtual desktop. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 147) How do I keep a window from being resized by the user? Resizing the window is done through the window manager; window managers can pay attention to the size hints your application places on the window, but there is no guarantee that the window manager will listen. You can try setting the minimum and maximum size hints to your target size and hope for the best. [1/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 148) How do I keep a window in the foreground at all times? Its rather antisocial for an application to constantly raise itself [e.g. by tracking VisibilityNotify events] so that it isnt overlapped -- imagine the conflict between two such programs running. The only sure way to have your window appear on the top of the stack is to make the window override-redirect; this means that you are temporarily assuming window-management duties while the window is up, so you want to do this infrequently and then only for short periods of time (e.g. for popup menus or other short parameter-setting windows). [thanks to der Mouse 7/92] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 149) How do I make text and bitmaps blink in X? There is no easy way. Unless youre willing to depend on some sort of extension (as yet non-existent), you have to arrange for the blinking yourself, either by redrawing the contents periodically or, if possible, by playing games with the colormap and changing the color of the contents. [Thanks to (der Mouse), 7/91] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 150)+ How do I get a double-click in Xlib? Users of Xt have the support of the translation manager to help get notification of double-clicking. There is no good way to get only a double-click in Xlib, because the protocol does not provide enough support to do double-clicks. You have to do client-side timeouts, unless the single-click action is such that you can defer actually taking it until you next see an event from the server. Thus, you have to do timeouts, which means system-dependent code. On most UNIXish implementations, you can use XConnectionNumber to get the file descriptor of the X connection and then use select() or something similar on that. Note that many user-interface references suggest that a double-click be used to extend the action indicated by a single-click; if this is the case in your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise check the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it, too, should be the single-click action or the double-click action. [Thanks to (der Mouse), 4/93] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 151)! How do I render rotated text? Xlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics capabilities, leaving them up to server-extensions or clients-side graphics libraries. Your only choice, if you want to stay within the core X protocol, is to render the text into a pixmap, read it back via XGetImage(), rotate it ""by hand"" with whatever matrices you want, and put it back to the server via XPutImage(); more specifically: 1) create a bitmap B and write your text to it. 2) create an XYBitmap image I from B (via XGetImage). 3) create an XYBitmap Image I2 big enough to handle the transformation. 4) for each x,y in I2, I2(x,y) = I(a,b) where a = x * cos(theta) - y * sin(theta) b = x * sin(theta) + y * cos(theta) 5) render I2 Note that you should be careful how you implement this not to lose bits; an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better. The high-level server-extensions and graphics packages available for X also permit rendering of rotated text: Display PostScript, PEX, PHiGS, and GKS, although most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use the same fonts that would be found on a printer. In addition, if you have enough access to the server to install a font on it, you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at some predefined angle. Your application can then itself figure out placement of each glyph. [courtesy der Mouse Eric Taylor and Ken Lee 11/90; Liam Quin 12/90] InterViews (C++ UI toolkit, in the X contrib software) has support for rendering rotated fonts in X. It could be one source of example code. [Brian R. Smith 3/91] Another possibility is to use the Hershey Fonts; they are stroke-rendered and can be used by X by converting them into XDrawLine requests. 10/91] The xrotfont program by Alan Richardson (posted to comp.sources.x July 14 1992) paints a rotated font by implementing the method above and by using an outline (Hershey) font. The xvertext package by Alan Richardson is a set of functions to facilitate the writing of text at any angle. Version 3.0 was recently released to alt.sources and comp.sources.misc [3/93]; it is also on export as contrib/xvertext.3.0.shar.Z. OReillys X Resource Volume 3 includes information from HP about modifications to the X fonts server which provide for rotated and scaled text. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subject: 152) What is the X Registry? (How do I reserve names?) There are places in the X Toolkit, in applications, and in the X protocol that define and use string names. The context is such that conflicts are possible if different components use the same name for different things. The MIT X Consortium maintains a registry of names in these domains: orgainization names, selection names, selection targets, resource types, application classes, and class extension record types; and several others. The list as of 7/91 is in the directory mit/doc/Registry on the R5 tape; it is also available by sending ""send docs registry"" to the xstuff mail server. To register names (first come, first served) or to ask questions send to be sure to include a postal address for confirmation.

Cassini is a joint NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997. After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturns atmosphere, rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturns satellites, and characterize Titans atmosphere and surface. One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to peer through Titans clouds and determine if there is liquid on the surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere. The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of Saturns satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true nature of Saturns rings.

The satellite also will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean. ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera. Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from that planet by sliding over Jupiters north pole in a gravity-assist manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Suns south pole in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- thats right, a solar-studies spacecraft thats always further from the Sun than the Earth is! While in Jupiters neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992).

12,12.0,0.7266,"line, power, work, current, ground, wire, switch, make, cable, signal","From: Subject: Grounding power wiring, was Re: a question about 120VAC outlet wiring Lines: 163 Nntp-Posting-Host: auvax1 Organization: Adelphi University, Garden City NY There has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding practices here. A few points need to be clarified: The Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or the metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects. It should never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the normal operating current of a connected load. Some equipment has filters in the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding conductor. Much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages on the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding conductors to provide reliable operation (""orange"" outlets are often used for this, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in many cases back to the service. Anyone installing such a system should read both the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on installing quiet isolated ground systems. The code requires the insulated grounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors back to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service entrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod) Many of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide a safe ground or a quiet ground or either. The GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is referred to in the code as the ""identified"" conductor and is supposed to be white or natural grey. This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in most electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance panel. This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper. (In many household service panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel) The Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor. In the case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the circuit from the panel to the load device. Since the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding conductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance from the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load, under normal operating conditions. If you should (incorrectly) connect the grounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor. Since there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end. If the load equipment has a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the ""U"" ground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential. The difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few tenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two. This normally does not present a shock hazard. HOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator, a metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to flow through this aalternate ground path. If the contact is not solid, you will get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc) Under the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire. It is possible in some cases that the sneak ground current could also flow through a wire of inadequate size, causing it to overheat. With the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a short circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which increases the possibility for shock or fire. Also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often causing malfunction. I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment. The Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as well as at the service entrance of each dwelling. This is done primarily for lightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back to ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses quickly. The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer. Some of it flows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks, and it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop between the ""hot"" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the water pipe and ground. There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy. (dont flame ME on this, Im just telling you where the field comes from, not its health effect, as far as Im concerned, the jury is still out on this.) Note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any sub distribution panels. This is one reason why it is illegal to run service entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral. The sheath can be used in this application only as the groundING conductor. If the neutral is bonded to the grounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding screw, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above ground, with the possible problems listed above. The code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one building to another. In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be used as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate wire. Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review. These exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days before U ground outlets and such. The appliance manufacturers dont want to have to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors dont want to have to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place of three wire to the appliances. No question it would be safer with seperate neutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings (since most current is in the 220 volt ""hots"" except at some low settings, the wires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage. So far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings, its primarily for lightning protection. People doing wiring should be aware what is and what isnt a legal grounding conductor. Obviously, the bare wire in ""romex"" with ground is. Anywhere there is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good grounding conductor. The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes is a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath. You can just cut this aluminum band off at the ends, you dont have to bond it to anything, it does its job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall tubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding locknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes. ""Greenfield"" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty sheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesnt have the aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and inductance. You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the greenfield. ""Wiremold"" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes often prevents good contact, and the ""feed"" to the wiremold extension is often from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold box. I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were ""hot"" with 120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator here in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box. You must run a ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in the original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can ""bond"" the wire to the box with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever. On another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets when ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them without a ground if no ground is available. It is better to have the protection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you dont install it. The interrupter doesnt depend on the ground to trip. It is desirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is connected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in, whereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something provides a ground path. For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded GCFIs, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my 93 code is in the city, but I know the rule hasnt changed. It might be renumbered though.) We have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more to this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.

In my follow-up to Jason Smiths posting, I will address some issues that have caused misunderstanding: Jason Smith wrote: > In article (Petri Pihko) writes: > I also concede that I was doubly remiss, as I asserted ""No reasonable > alternative exists"", an entirely subjective statement on my part (and one > that could be invalidated, given time and further discovery by the > scientist).

Am I mistaken with this understanding? Yes, to some degree. There was an excellent discussion in sci.skeptic on the nature of scientific work two weeks ago, I hope it did not escape your notice. The correct word is likely. There is no way to be sure our models and theories are absolutely correct. Theories are backed up by evidence, but not proved - no theory can be true in a mathematical sense. However, theories are not mere descriptions or rationalisations of phenomena. It is extremely important to test whether theories can _predict_ something new or not yet observed. All successful theories science has come up with have passed this test, including the Big Bang theory of cosmic evolution, the theory of natural selection etc. It does not mean they _must_ be correct, but they are not mere best fits for the data. > = But if you claim that there must be > = an answer to ""how"" did the universe (our spacetime) emerge from > = ""nothing"", science has some good candidates for an answer. > All of which require something we Christians readily admit to: ``Faith. Well, yes, if you want to _believe_ in them. This is not what science requires - take a good look at the theory and the evidence, see if the theory has made any successful predictions, and use your reason. Disbelievers are not punished. > The fact that there are several candidates belies that *none* are conclusive. > With out conclusive evidence, we are left with faith. This is what puzzles me - why do we need to have faith in _anything_? My fellow atheists would call me a weak atheist - someone who is unable to believe, ie, fails to entertain any belief in God. Yes, I know that one cant believe without Gods help; Luther makes this quite clear in his letter to Erasmus. Im afraid this does not change my situation. > [ a couple of paragraphs deleted.

Tautology at its best. > Carefully examine the original question, and then the ""counter-question"". > The first asks ""Why"", while the second is a request for definition. No, it is not, although it does look like one. This is a true dichotomy, either something exists, or nothing exists. If nothing exists, nobody would ask why. If something exists, it is possible to ask why, but actually no existing being could give an answer. Imagine, for a moment, that the nobodies in non-existence could also ask: ""Why nothing exists?"" This is equivalent to my counter-question, ""why nothing exists in nothingness"". Now, ""why anything exists"" is equivalent to ""why something exists in somethingness"". _This_ is what I meant with my tautology, my apologies for the poor wording in my previous post. > I might add, the worldview of ""Things that exist do, and things that > dont...dont"" is as grounded in the realm of the non-falsifiable, > as does the theists belief in God.

I do indeed think there probably _is_ no reason for being, or existence, in general, for reasons I stated above. However, they will still leave open the question ""why this, and not that"", and this is where theistic explanations come in. Science cannot give reasons for any _particular_ human beings existence. > We come to this. Either ""I am, therefore I am."", or ""I am for a reason."" This is a deep philosophical question - is determinism true, or not? Also, is God deterministic or not? I tend to think this question has no meaning in His case. If I am for a reason, Ive yet failed to see what it would be. From our perspective, it looks like I exist for truly random reasons. I just rolled two dice - why did I get 6 and 1? How can I believe there is any better reason for my existence? > If the former is a satisfactory answer, then you are done, for you are > satisfied, and need not a doctor.

No, it doesnt, but I think an existing God cannot know why He exists, for an answer to this question is not knowable. Of course, this should not be any obstacle to belief in His existence. > I also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer ""why"". It > appears that M. Pihko agrees (as we shall see). But because a tool is > inadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question. Asserting > that why is an invalid question does not provide an answer. It is impossible to know unknowable things. However, the question ""why do I exist, in particular"" is _not_ an invalid question - this is not what I said. But from our perspective, it is impossible to tell, and I cant just believe in any given explanation instead of another, especially since I found I was deluding myself. > My apologies. I was using why as ""why did this come to be"". Why did > pre-existence become existence. Why did pre-spacetime become spacetime. I think ""pre-existence"" is an oxymoron. There is no time outside of this spacetime (except in some other universe), and from that perspective, our universe never was. It exists only for those who are inside it. > But we come to the admission that science fails to answer ""Why?"". Because > it cant be answered in the realm of modern science, does that make the > question invalid? No. The validity of the question has to be discussed separately; I think philosophy is of great help here. What can be known, and what is not knowable? > M. Pihko does present a good point though.

This is a very good question. In trying to answer this, and numerous other questions that bothered me, I finally found nothing to base my faith on.

They are news because they are the exceptions. And the Islamic Holocaust is much the topic of the day. The historical evidence proves that during the period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religion and national origin. Armenians perpetrated acts of sabotage, destroyed telephone cables, blew up bridges, blocked passes, set up ambushes, attacked security stations and small Turkish outposts behind the Ottoman Army lines on the one hand, and on the other ruthlessly attacked Turkish and Kurdish villages, slaughtering the Turkish population indiscriminately, women, children, old and young alike. Innocent Muslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death, or massacred with axes and swords, or else shut up in mosques or in schools and then burnt alive as can be seen below. Widespread Armenian massacres of innocent Muslims took place in regions of Van, Kars, Sivas, Erzurum, Bitlis, Erzincan, Mus, Diyarbakir and Maras. The Ottoman Army, while fighting to prevent the Russian invasion, also had to deal with Armenian genocide squads who cowardly hit from behind. The Armenian genocide of the Muslims spread to all parts of Eastern Anatolia. Starting from late 1914, Armenians committed widespread massacres and genocide in Eastern Anatolia, because the arena was left to the Armenians. Almost every Turkish town and village from Erzincan up to Azerbaidjan suffered large scale massacres and genocide by Armenians and the Turkish genocide has been documented by Armenian, Russian, American, British, Ottoman, German, Austrian and French journalists and officers who observed the first genocide of this century committed by the blood-thirsty Armenian genocide squads. The Ottoman Army, liberating Trabzon, Bayburt, Erzincan, Erzurum, Kars and other regions from the Russians, saw that the cities and their villages had been destroyed and burnt, people slaughtered, massacred. The massacres conducted by Armenians, which became a black stain for humanity, shocked and disgusted even the Russian, British, German, Austrian, French and American authorities. Almost every Ottoman document is related to Armenian massacres and cruelties. The inhuman treatment, cruelties, atrocities, genocide by Armenian genocide squads perpetrated against innocent Moslem Turkish and Kurdish people, are sufficiently reflected in historical documents. Even today over seventy-five years later, the terrifying screams of the victims of these cruelties can be heard. Source: Documents: Volume I (1919).

""I have been closely following for two weeks the withdrawal of Russians and Armenians from Turkish territories through Armenia.

All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed. Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly slain are everywhere. According to accounts by those who were able to save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun. They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs. I am now in Erzurum, and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air. Although there are speculations that Armenian gangs murdered Austrian and German prisoners as well, I could not get the supporting evidence in this regard, but there is proof of murdering of Turkish prisoners of war.""

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links. For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans. Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement. Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer. It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files. While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals. A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the ""Clipper Chip"" has been developed by government engineers. The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology. It can be used in new, relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone. It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today. This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically. At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. A ""key-escrow"" system will be established to ensure that the ""Clipper Chip"" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans. Each device containing the chip will have two unique 2 ""keys,"" numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device. When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately in two ""key-escrow"" data bases that will be established by the Attorney General. Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap. The ""Clipper Chip"" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices. In addition, respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings. The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryptions dual-edge sword: encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield criminals and terrorists. We need the ""Clipper Chip"" and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities. In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates: -- the privacy of our citizens, including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes; -- the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data, under proper court or other legal order, when necessary to protect our citizens; -- the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the National Information Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of American industry in the global marketplace; and -- the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export high technology products. The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed. 3 The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information. This infrastructure of high-speed networks (""information superhighways"") will transmit video, images, HDTV programming, and huge data files as easily as todays telephone system transmits voice. Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding its use. The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law. Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. The provisions of the Presidents directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available. For additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of Standards and Technology, (301) 975-2758. --------------------------------- QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATIONS TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE Q: Does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations? A: No. ""Clipper Chip"" technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans. Q: Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device. What would they have to do to decipher the message? A: They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a court order, to do the wiretap in the first place. They would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers. The key is split into two parts, which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system. Q: Who will run the key-escrow data banks? A: The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities. At this point, the Department of Justice and the Administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key-escrow data banks. Q: How strong is the security in the device? How can I be sure how strong the security is? A: This system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today. While the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities. Q: Whose decision was it to propose this product? A: The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in this decision. This approach has been endorsed by the President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet officials. Q: Who was consulted? The Congress? Industry? A: We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy. We have briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative. Q: Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers? A: The government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers. Product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them. Q: Who provides the ""Clipper Chip""? A: Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance, California, and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers. The programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future. Q: How do I buy one of these encryption devices? A: We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the ""Clipper Chip"" into their devices. Q: If the Administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices? A: This is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review. The key escrow mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive than others readily available today, but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology, which the Administration is developing. The Administration is not saying, ""since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement, we will prohibit it outright"" (as some countries have effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that ""every American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product."" There is a false ""tension"" created in the assessment that this issue is an ""either-or"" proposition. Rather, both concerns can be, and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned, balanced approach such as is proposed with the ""Clipper Chip"" and similar encryption techniques. Q: What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton Administrations policy toward encryption will differ from that of the Bush Administration? A: It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public-interest groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism. Q: Will the devices be exportable? Will other devices that use the government hardware? A: Voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements. Case-by-case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices. The same is true for other encryption devices. One of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad. With this in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad. We plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products. -- Jim Gillogly Trewesday, 25 Astron S.R. 1993, 17:01 "

I a single drive environment the drive is described as a Master. In a dual drive environment the drives are described as a Master and a Slave. This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives when performing diagnostics. There are four links, LK1, LK2, LK4 and LK5, adjacent to the 40 way interface connector. They have the following functions and are described in order as viewed from the end of the drive, with the first jumper described nearest the 40 way interface connector. LK2: LED When fitted, this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130 Ohms ot 220 Ohms. LK1: Dual Drives This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector, indicating, to the Master drive, the presence of a Slave. LK4: Master When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be jumpered in this way. LK5: IOChRdy When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive, it is fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per second. There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s) may be jumpered: Master, single drive with LED on interface LK2 & LK4 fitted. Master, single drive without LED on interface LK4 only fitted. Master, dual drive without LED on interface LK4 & LK1 fitted. Slave, dual drive without LED on interface No jumpers fitted. Master, dual drive with LED on interface LK4, LK1 & LK2 fitted. Slave, dual drive with LED on interface LK2 only fitted. The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to reduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used. The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way connector at the other end of the drive. This LED driver is not affected by the link options. An internal current limiting resistor is on the drive for this LED driver.

If IDE speed come from IDA WHERE does the 8.3MB/s sighted for IDE come from? SCSI is not complex. It is just the way the industry uses and talks about it. There are THREE key differences in SCSI; the controller chip, the port, and the software. THAT IS IT. Let us look as SCSi in from THIS stand point. SCSI-1: asynchronous and synchronous modes {SOFTWARE SCSI DRIVER ONLY} asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode {only 0-3MB/s vs. 0-5MB/s} synchronous speeds can be reached by most SCSi-1 divices with a rewrite of the software driver {As is the case for the Mac Quadra.} SCSI-2 {8-bit}: THIS is the main source for the confusion. This differs from SCSI-1 ONLY in the controler chip in most machines. In the Mac and some PCs this is called fast SCSI-1 because it uses SCSI-1 ports and software drivers AND can produce SCSI-2 SPEEDS through SCSI-1 INSPITE of this even in the slower asynchronous mode. Average speed in asynchronous SCSi-1 mode 4-6MB/s with 8MB/s{See in both Quadras and higher end PCs} Synchronous mode just allows a higher burst rate {10/MB/s} SCSI-2 {16-bit}: TWO versions-Wide/Fast. Wide SCSI-2 requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2: a SCSI-2 software driver and a wide SCSI port on the machine and the external device. Fast SCSI-2 also requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2: SCSI-2 driver software and that the RECIEVING devise support 16-bit fast SCSI-2. Speed of both is the same: 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst. SCSI-2 {32-bit}: Also know as Wide AND Fast SCSI. Over 8-bit SCSI-2 this requires: SCSI-2 driver software, wide SCSI-2 port, and that the RECIEVING devices ALSO have a 32-bit mode SCSI-2 chip. As expected this is VERY expencive. Speed: 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s bursts As I said SIMPLE. Seven versions of SCSI seperated by software, the controler chip, and the port. Standarize the SOFTWARE and it DROPS to only FIVE versions of SCSI seperate by only HARDWARE {the chip and the port} "

Steve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci. Med. Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did not exist. Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well. Let me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have no idea how the human body interacts with its environment and how that balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics. These are the physicians who dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go from doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) and then when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling quack. Could it just be professional jealousy? I couldnt help Elaine or Jon but somebody else did. Could they know more than Me? No way, they must be a quack. Ive been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten years now and guess who the most receptive students are? Those that were raised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to entering medical school(switched to the vegan diet). Typically, this is about 1/3 of my class of 90 students. Those not interested in nutrition either tune me out or just stop coming to class. Thats okay because I know that some of what Im teaching is going to stick and there will be at least a few ""enlightened"" physicians practicing in the U.S. Its really too bad that most U.S. medical schools dont cover nutrition because if they did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the medical profession. In animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with ""good"" bacteria after antibiotics are stopped. Medicine has decided that since humans do not have a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with ""good"" bacteria is needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic. Humans have all kinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin. These are nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune system is compromised. They are also called nonpathogens because unlike the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body. But any of these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up residence within the body. A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier. Steve got real upset with Elaines doctor because he was using anti-fungals and vitamin A for her GI problems. If Steve really understoood what vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling Elaines doctor a quack. Here is a brief primer on yeast. Yeast infections, as they are commonly called, are not truely caused by yeasts. The most common organism responsible for this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a yeast-like fungus. An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis. Candidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it requires that the host immune system be severly depressed. Candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing factor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral course of antibiotics has been used. In diabetics, their secretions contain much higher amounts of glucose. Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in its food(fuel) selection. Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely survives. If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina. In diabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little buggers. The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus membrane or skin bloom site. Whether this is an allergic like reaction to the candida or not isnt certain. When the bloom is in the vagina or on the skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to ""treat"" it. If its internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty nondiscript. Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the vaginal tract which compete with it for food. The human immune system ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless they broach the mucus membrane ""barrier"". If they do, an inflammatory response will be set up. Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A from their diets. About 30% of all Americans die with less Vitamin A than they were born with(U.S. autopsy studies). While this low level of vitamin A does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane barrier system. This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong inflammatory response after a candida bloom. While diabetics can suffer from a candida ""bloom"" the most common cause of this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main competition for candida as far as food is concerned. While drugs are available to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection. The toxicity of the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution. But if the GI or sinus inflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum antibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring vaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says. But even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by the excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of the problem is addressed(lack of a ""good"" bacterial flora in the body and/or poor mucus membrane barrier). Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective therapy for candida overgrowth. From its name, it is an acid loving organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows. Candida can not grow very well in an acidic environment. In the vagina, L. acidophilius is the predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum antibiotics). In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract. One of the most effctive ways to minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear. If the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids. If the bloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology occurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool). This positive stool for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first place. After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong but her gut still hurt. On to another doctor, and so on. Richard Kaplan has told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of false positives(candida blooms guys?). If my gut hurt me on a constant basis, I would want it fixed. Yes its nice to know that I dont have colon cancer but what then is causing my distress? When I finally find a doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack. Candida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment. The vagina becomes alkaline during a womans period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina. Vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal problems. Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of Lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of the purity of the product before trying this). My wife had this vagina problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting scripts for anti-fungal creams. This was a woman gynocologist who had had the same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections). This M.D. did some digging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she used in your office to keep it sterile. After three treatments, sex returned to our marraige. I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his patients is a non-existent syndrome. The nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women. If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut. Through aresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes. But before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system needs to be strengthened. This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and some of the B-complex vitamins. Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans are not getting enough B6 and folate. These are probably the segement of the population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent disorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy). Some of the above material was obtained from ""Natural Healing"" by Mark Bricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human nutrition course. I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A sometime in the future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely important role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in the body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida blooms. Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate intake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI system is involved. If candida can not get glucose, its not going to out grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and fatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check once carbohydrate is returned to the gut. If Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post, fine. I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctors use of vitamin A and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut. People seeking advice from newsnet should not be treated this way. Those of us giving of our time and knowledge can slug it out to our hearts content. If you saved your venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly seeking help alone, I wouldnt have a problem with your behavior.

A: Typically, you will see something like 195/60HR14. the 195 is the overall width of the tire in millimeters, the tread is usually narrower. The 60 is the `aspect ratio; it indicates the height of the sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width. Our example tire has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm. The 14 is the wheel diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like 390, which is in millimeters. The R means Radial, and the H is a speed rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate. Common speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to 150MPH.) Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice. What follows is a table showing a number of `load indices and corresponding maximum per-tire loads: Load Index 50 51 88 89 112 113 145 149 157 Max Load (Kg) 190 195 560 580 1120 1150 2900 3250 4125 Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table. In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation indicates Passenger car. If no letter is given, then the application of the tire is Passenger car usage. As far as I know, these letters only appear in the US market. The LT designation is prinicipally of interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles. For the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at all. If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78. Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.) There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature, traction, and treadwear. Temperature and Traction are graded A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is a numeric rating. These values are of limited value, as they are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires. Q: My car has tires with a funny size designation: 185/65HR390; can i put normal tires on the car? A: Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin. Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.) You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner, or possibly blow out at high speed.) TRX type tires are becoming hard to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires. Goodyear has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires. Q: Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side of my car? A: Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping is done. The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturers recommendations. Q: How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the car should I put them on? A: In short, 4, and both ends. To explain, many drivers in areas that dont get excessive snow or who dont drive agressively (or at all) in snow conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice. With a rear wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car (a function of the front axle.) In a front wheel drive car, you start, stop, and turn with the front end. The primary risk of putting the snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards. Radar Detectors and Speed Limits: Q: Why arent there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits in this Q&A posting? A: Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless flame wars. If you want to talk about either of these topics, please subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there. Safety Equipment: Q: Do airbags really work? A: Preliminary statistics suggest the following: Airbags work much better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than 3 point belts alone. The con to airbags is that some designs tend to burn the drivers hands when venting the byproducts of the explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but not all) may knock the drivers hands from the wheel, making retention of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult. Brake Questions: Q: Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned? Midas always wants to do this. A: No. There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors more often than is strictly necessary. if the rotors are not warped warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or to turn them. Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped, or badly grooved. Q: They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down. Is this really a good idea? A: It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade prone drum brakes. In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases of long, steep downhill runs. Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings. On the other hand, many standard drivers license tests in the USA still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I suggest that before taking a US drivers test, you either 1) learn to do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a car with an automatic to take the test. Q: How often should I replace my brake fluid? A: Probably more often than you do. Traditional brake fluids tend to absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid. DOT-3 type are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications. The principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling point is important in older brake fluid. DOT-3 fluids have the lowest wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see the next Q&A for more details.) While the requirements imply that DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly competition applications. Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_ improved brake pedal feel. Replacement once a year is recommended for DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid out of the brake calipers fairly regularly. Q: What about DOT-5 brake fluids? A: This breaks down in to two parts. The DOT-5 specification looks excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone based. Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition. Unlike DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all. While this may sound like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring. The water will tend to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where most of the corrosion occurs. Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the brake system when converting to Silicone fluids. Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids: 1) they are difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids. SIlicone fluids may make sense in some street car applications, but they are certainly not recommended for high performance driving applications, and the economics are questionable for street use. I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little information at this time. Q: ABS is available on some of the cars Im looking at, but it costs more. Is it worth it? A: This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons. The short answer is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally work better for the `average driver (that is to say, a driver who does not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques), and may require the `unlearning of some obsolete braking techniques like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case. Now for the long answer. ABS works by monitering the wheels of the car, looking for signs of locked brakes. It may or may not be able be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several systems on the market.) It cannot detect impending lockup (which is what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence of lockup. The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original equipment or OE-equivalent components. When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the system.) If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is achieved.) This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as the system cycles. The percentage of the time that the brakes are truly engaged is called the `duty cycle; typically in an ABS system this is about 40% On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking; on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform threshold braking nearly every time. Unfortunately, on mud and on snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars, has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this eventuality. A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves steering control. This is the case simply because, if you are braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied. Braking distances will lengthen accordingly. An important caution: ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on glare ice, dont expect an ABS system to help you out very much. The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an ABS system in your car. As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential restrictions Ive listed above, you have to worry about the following: 1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for over $1000. Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5 (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles. Because of the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid becomes very important. Q: What about this threshold braking business? A: [normally, Id not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is needed here -- rpw] Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab the pedal and lock em up panic habit entirely, and is much to be prefered. Basically, the premise is that tires generate maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but just before the wheels lock up entirely. Drivers who threshold brake learn to feel what this `threshold feels like, and learn to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake pedal. In many cars, you can feel that you are near the threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it. In any case, if you cant hear the tires whine just a bit, youre not very near the threshold. In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very close to the threshold and theyll probably achieve better stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS take over. Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with ABS systems. The police departments in question quickly blamed the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the involved officers had any recent performance driving training. There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing brake pedal by `pump braking, an old and discredited technique of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system. If you think about it for a minute, youll realize that pump braking must cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least 1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason. Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at the pedal will be sufficient. Gas Questions: Q: Does High Octane gasoline help? A: Maybe, maybe not. Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used. On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your car run well. Check your owners manual for details on what your car needs. Q: My car was made for leaded gasoline. Will unleaded gas hurt it? A: It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear, although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise. The actual increase in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded gasolines actually contain very little lead. You should, however, check your owners manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not actually require leaded gasoline. Q: Do fuel treatments help? What kind should I use? A: Some do and some dont. During the winter, it is a good idea to use dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems. Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection. Manufacturers opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owners manual on your car before using these. Most manufacturers consider 10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline. Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol (Isopropanol), and Petroleum Distillates are fine in fuel injected cars. An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that do the same job. Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything in your gas tank. There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work much, much better. Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1, Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber, and BG 44K. A bottle of one of these, once every six months, is highly recommended. Q: What about detergent gasolines? A: The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this test may advertise that fact. Stickers indicating passage of the test are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations. If such gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional. Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits. Lubrication Questions: Q: What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean? A: There are several different items encoded. There is a two-letter code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such. The S codes are for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine applications. The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE, SE is considered better than SD, and so forth. The more noticeable designation is the oil weight. This is either a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by the letter W (e.g., 10W30.) The latter type is much more commonly used these days, and are the only type that most automobile manufacturers specify in operators manuals. The first number in the designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold; the W stands for `winter. The second number (30) is the viscosity of the oil when hot. There is a trick here; the oil doesnt actually get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter. What is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity of a cold 10 weight oil. as it gets hotter, it doesnt get thin as fast as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil. Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all 30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot. Note also that the novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time. 10W30, 15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though. Q: Are `quick lube places any good? A: Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out there. Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure that they dont overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on your wallet at all times. Q: Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good? A: Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives. Many of these have come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based additives that have been around since the early 50s. PTFE is the chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general, auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products. Most USENET responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are debatable. Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage. Some BMW owners have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of Slick 50 to their cars. This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50 Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as it may clog the oil return passages in the engine. Otherwise, there are no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives. On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world. Q: Do synthetic oils really work? A: Yes, but. More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics, but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by oil manufacturers. Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your car. Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty as conventional oils. Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very effective. Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however. Q: Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals. How often should I change my oil? A: It depends on how you drive. If your car always (or nearly always) gets warmed up, and you dont drive it very hard and keep the revs down, the manufacturers recommendation is probably fine. If, however, you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesnt get up to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often, perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are now specifying 7500 mile intervals.) If you dont drive your car much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change oil every six months anyway. If you are storing a car during the winter, then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out of storage. Misc. Questions: Q: My car has a timing belt. I hear that bad things happen when they break. Whats the story? A: It depends on the internal design of the motor. Early Ford Escorts, for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt. Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be. If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent replacement. Ask your dealer or independent mechanic. Also, ask if there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize, destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage as a side effect. Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water pump can be a costly mistake.) Q: Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it self destructs when the timing belt breaks? A: For performance reasons. Compromising piston design so that the valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance oriented vehicles. Q: What causes Unintended Acceleration? A: The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the same time be consistent with the physical evidence. The NHTSA report goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication by the vehicle operator is probably the cause. -- richard welty 518-393-7228 ``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of a race car about either its pitch or roll axis -- Carroll Smith "

Four coplanar points in the shape of a square have no unique sphere that they are on the surface of. Similarly 4 colinear point have no finite sized sphere that they are on the surface of. These algorithms being geometrical designed rather than algebraically design meet these problems neatly. When determining which plane the 3 points are on if they are colinear the algorithm should afil or return infinite R. When intersecting the two lines there are 2 possibilities they are the same line (the 4 points were on a planar circle) they are different lines but parallel. There is a sphere of in radius. This last case can be achieved with 3 colinier points and any 4th point by taking the 4th point and pairs of the first 3 parallel lines will be produced it can also be achieved by If all 4 points are coplanar but are not on one circle. It seems to me that the algorithm only fails when the 4 points are coplanar. The algorithm always fails when the points are coplanar. (4 points being colinear => coplanar) Testing if the 4th point is coplanar when the plane of the first 3 points has been found is trivial. >An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formed >by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the >center of the sphere.

To render obscure. X b. To darken. 2. To confuse: Their emotions obfuscated X their judgment. [LLat. obfuscare, to darken : ob(intensive) + X Lat. fuscare, to darken < fuscus, dark.] -obfuscation n. X obfuscatory adj. X X GOALS OF THE CONTEST: X X * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below. X * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way. X * To stress C compilers with unusual code. X * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language. X * To provide a safe forum for poor C code. :-) X X The IOCCC is the grandfather of USENET programming contests. Since X 1984, this contest demonstrated that a program that simply works X correctly is not sufficient. The IOCCC has also done much to add X the arcane word obfuscated back into the English language. X (see ""The New Hackers Dictionary"" by Eric Raymond) X X You are strongly encouraged to read the new contest rules before X sending any entries. The rules, and sometimes the contest Email X address itself, change over time. A valid entry one year may X be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules. The typical X start date for contests is in early March. Contest rules are normally not X finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest. The typical X closing date for contests are in early May. X X The rules and the guidelines may (and often do) change from year to X year. You should be sure you have the current rules and guidelines X prior to submitting entries. To obtain them, send Email to the address X above and use the subject send rules.

Its purpose: X X * To spread knowledge of PostScript and its details. X * To applaud those with the best tricks. X * To prove that humans can beat those damnable machine generators at X their own game by writing the most obscure and mysterious PostScript X programs ever. X X Winners will receive the fame and attention that goes with having their X program entry posted as a winner to programmers world-wide. X X The 1993 contest rules and results are available by ftp as X ``wilma.cs.brown.edu:pub/postscript/obfuscated*.shar, or individually X in the obfuscated directory.
