# AI-Lab 
üìÅ Generated by: Muhammad Angga Muttaqien, in Jan 7, 2018

üî¨ Absolutely comfort lab for me to work around with my own AI pieces of stuff and see a lot of surprises, often times, indistinguishable from magic. The major exploration topics include:

1. Machine Learning
2. Deep Learning (e.g. visual, sequence and reinforcement learning)
3. Advanced Techniques (e.g. GAN, One-Shot Learning, Symbolic AI, Knowledge Graphs etc.)

The best way to get deeper into AI technology is to get hands-on with it. In 2019, I have an enthusiastic plan to experiment with various deep learning applications based on Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies. Learning-by-doing. Below is the list I envision:

## CV Applications
```text
1. Object Classification
2. Object Detection
3. Real-time Object Detection
4. Semantic Segmentation
5. Instance Segmentation
6. Human Pose Detection
7. Visual Question Answering
```

## NLP Applications
```text
1. Machine Translation System
2. Sentiment Analysis
3. Text Summarization
4. Topic Modeling
5. Chatbot
6. Image Captioning
7. Speech Recognition
```

## RL Applications
```text
1. MDP Using Dynamic Programming Method
2. Monte Carlo Method
3. Temporal-Difference Method
4. Actor-Critic Method
5. Multi Agent Method
6. Q-Learning Method
7. Deep Q-Learning Method (DQN, CNN-DQN, Double DQN & Dueling DQN Agent)
```

And Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications will come afterward...
