# AI-Lab 
üìÅ Generated by: Muhammad Angga Muttaqien, in Jan 7, 2018

üî¨ Absolutely comfort lab for me to work around with my own AIs and to empirically observe how powerful and impactful these technologies are. The key research topics are listed as follows:

1. Machine Learning
2. Deep Learning (e.g. vision, sequence and reinforcement learning)
3. Advanced Techniques (e.g. GAN, One-Shot Learning, Transformer, Multi-Agent Learning etc.)

`Now, I'm conducting research on Reinforcement Learning`

The best way to get deeper into AI technology is to get hands-on with it. In 2019-2020, I have an enthusiastic plan to conduct experiments with numerous and diverse deep learning applications based on Computer Vision ([CV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision)), Natural Language Processing ([NLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing)) and Reinforcement Learning ([RL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning)) technologies. Through learning-by-doing, below is the list I envision:

## CV Applications
```text
1. Object Classification
2. Object Detection
3. Real-time Object Detection
4. Semantic Segmentation
5. Instance Segmentation
6. Human Pose Detection
7. Visual Question Answering
```

## NLP Applications
```text
1. Machine Translation System
2. Sentiment Analysis
3. Text Summarization
4. Topic Modeling
5. Chatbot
6. Image Captioning
7. Speech Recognition
```

## RL Applications
```text
1. Dynamic Programming Method for MDPs
2. Monte Carlo Method
3. Temporal-Difference Method (Sarsa, Sarsamax, Expected Sarsa)
4. Value-Based Method (DQN, Double-DQN, PER-DQN, Dueling-DQN, Noisy-DQN, Distributional-DQN, Rainbow-DQN)
5. Policy-Based Method (Reinforce, TRPO, PPO)
6. Actor-Critic Method (A2C/A3C, GAE, DDPG)
7. Multi-Agent Method
```

## Robotics Applications
```
The time will come soon.
