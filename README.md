# AI-Lab
ðŸ“¦ Absolutely comfort lab for me to work around with my own A(G)I pieces of stuff and see a lot of surprises indistinguishable from magic! The major exploration topics include:

1. Machine Learning
2. Deep Learning (e.g. visual, sequence and reinforcement learning)

In 2019, I have a big plan to release my well-designed products based on Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tech. Below is the list I visioned:

[CV PRODUCTS]
1. Object Classification
2. Object Detection
3. Real-Time Object Detection
4. Semantic & Instance Segmentation
5. Pose Detection

[NLP PRODUCTS]
1. Machine Translation System
2. Search Engine System
3. Text Summarisation
4. Sentiment Analysis
5. Chat-bot System

[CV + NLP PRODUCTS]
1. Optical Character Recognition
2. Image Captioning
3. Dense Captioning
4. Visual Question Answering
5. Shape/ Object Generation

And Reinforcement Learning (RL) products will come afterward...
