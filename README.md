# AI-Lab 
üìÅ Generated by: Muhammad Angga Muttaqien, in Jan 7, 2018

üî¨ Absolutely comfort lab for me to work around with my own AI pieces of stuff and see a lot of surprises, often times, indistinguishable from magic. The major exploration topics include:

1. Machine Learning
2. Deep Learning (e.g. visual, sequence and reinforcement learning)
3. Advanced Techniques (e.g. GAN, One-Shot Learning, Symbolic AI, Knowledge Graphs etc.)

In 2019, I have a big plan to experiment with various deep learning application based on Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies. Learning-by-doing. Below is the list I envision:


## CV Applications
```text
1. Object Classification
2. Object Detection
3. Real-time Object Detection
4. Semantic Segmentation
5. Instance Segmentation
6. Human Pose Detection
```

## NLP Applications
```text
1. Machine Translation System
2. Sentiment Analysis
3. Text Summarization
4. Topic Modeling
5. Chatbot
6. Image Captioning
7. Visual Question Answering
8. Speech Recognition
```

And Reinforcement Learning (RL) products will come afterward...
